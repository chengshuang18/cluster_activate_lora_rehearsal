Its got numerous hot songs, and the bonus tracks are BLAZIN!!!!! Who we be and Damien 3 show dmx lyrical talent and are bangers. Trinamoe is a hella tight song. He still follows his murderous rampage songs with ima bang and #11 and it still works. He also gives a message in most of his songs. I Miss You and A Minute 4 ur son, shroty was the bomb are the most inspired songs an are great to listen too when ur just chillin. Be sure to listen to the 3 bonus tracks after the last song, all 3 are Hella TIght and show the new bloodline rappers (...). Anny dmx fan will love this album.\n"

I can't say that any one of the characters is particularly compelling or likable, but their stories will most certainly keep the reader turning the pages to see what happens to them.

I bought the Vista Cx because I thought the built-in barometric altimeter would reduce the problem with satellite determined elevations - it does not. The expected error in elevation is 50 to 200 feet, far worse than the positional accuracy of the gps. To reduce error Garmin recommends calibrating the unit every hour to a known elevation - if you know the elevation that well you don't need a gps!
