I liked the fact that it used flash memory with no moving parts to break. It is also expandable with an SD card, but I never tried it. I paid $135 from Amazon at the time.She used it happily for four months. It only \"crashed\" once with a weird memory error that wasn't obvious to reformat, but I figured it out somehow.Last night she told me it was broken; the VOLUME DOWN button wouldn't work. UP worked fine, but she couldn't turn the volume DOWN. I knew the unit was out of the 90-day warranty so I opened it. I found the volume-down switch separating from the circuit board. Rio wants $99 to replace it, so I'm going to try my best to fix it. Either way, I'll never buy another Rio product.I gave the unit one star since the cost of ownership in my experience is about $30/month.\n"

It was, however, one of the few King Arthur stories that I could stand to read all the way through. I would have liked to see Arylwren as a slightly more flawed character- she seemed too perfect and benign to be true, while everyone else was a bit of a mess. I think it had gaps, as well.

The PStwo either doesn't turn on at all, or it stays on, doesn't turn off, and doesn't do anything- no game load, no system browser, *nothing*.It looks like Pelican has discontinued the product ( I couldn't find it on their website ), and there is a clear reason.

Feasts are ultimately a spectacle where food is used to project personal influence, make deals and curry favors. As Strong shows, these motivations haven't changed thru seismic changes in the art of the meal (introduction of fork and spoon, tables, sugar, spice ..). The prehistoric culinary history spanning the Greek and Romans is fascinating, as is the rediscovery of these \"excesses\" under the watchful eyes of the church. The post-renaissance portrayal becomes less intrigue and more detail, although there are some nice segments about the effect of sugar, the rise and fall of spice and the emergence of etiquette. The latter half of the book could be more entertaining, but all in all worth a read.\n"

Throughout the book Cole goes through exciting problems that apparently help him. For instance, Cole gets mauled by the Spirit Bear. After he got mauled another 6 chapters was dedicated to what was happening to him as he was lying on the ground almost dead. After he was rescued from the mauling he had an un-realistic change in personality. He, all of a sudden, wanted to help Peter and other people. The book dragged out what happened to Cole and had over-specific details stating what happened. It has un-realistic consequences to what happens to people when they do something bad. It can teach children that if they do do something bad, they can get different consequences for what they did, even though it was wrong. Do not read this book.\n"

I really enjoy their movies in the past although Ryan is more likely to act in this movie then Jason. This movie would have been extremely funny if they would have toned it down on Ryan's role (the single guy) with all the sex and language. Basically the two guys (Jason - family man & Ryan - Single pot smoking/womanizer) switch bodies & try to deal with each others lives.I would not recommend this movie for anyone that does not enjoy listening to bad language, nudity & sex senses cause there is at least 50%.
