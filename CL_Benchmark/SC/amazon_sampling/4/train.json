Sometimes it seems like I get a \"tie\" -- pick one, open it, if the tone doesn't stop, it's the other one. Even under the worst of conditions where you can't decide, it's still somewhat handy, since flipping breakers one a time until the tone stops still beats flipping a breaker and jogging to some other part of the house to see if you got the right one.\n"

While it can be viewed as a very general \"introduction\" and is interesting in parts, it lacks the authority of scholarship and experience. The author, Idries Shah, was a self-proclaimed \"Sufi Master\" and falsely claimed numerous titles for himself. If you want a good, honest introduction to the Sufi path, read \"Heart, Self, and Soul\" by Robert Frager or\"Irshad\" by Muzaffer Ozak. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a New-Age, watered down, westernized \"Sufism\" stripped of it's spiritual essence, than I guess Idries Shah is for you\n"
