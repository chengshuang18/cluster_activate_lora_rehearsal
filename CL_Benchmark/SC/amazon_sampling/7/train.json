It's a bad game and the developer is hoping it will sell because of its sex appeal and intense amounts of gore. Don't be fooled, this game is going to be a mediocre (at best) action game. The game is basically a rip off Max Payne, Devil May Cry 2, and Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain with a lot more gore, sex appeal, and the gameplay doesn't nearly match up to the games it is \"ripping off\" from. The gameplay is supposivly very similar to Resident Evil. Although I love Resident Evil, this game is a fast paced action game and RE's controls are better suited for survival-horror..not action.Remember..there are lots of games out there with a lot of sex/gore appeal but that doesn't make them all good. Some such as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, BMX XXX, Resident Evil, or Mortal Kombat:Deadly Alliance (trust me, it will sincerely be a good game) will be good but others such as BloodRayne are just trash.\n"

The previous inspirational lyrics (\"Refugee\" and \"Even The Losers\" from DAMN THE TORPEDOES and \"I Won't Back Down\" from FULL MOON FEVER are wondrous examples) have, sadly, been replaced by mean-spirited hopelessness that cannot be mitigated by his advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in the wake of that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction against a young Australian tourist. It turns out that Petty is releasing a new album at the end of this year or the beginning of next, so let's hope it's less cynical and more hopeful than this one.\n"
