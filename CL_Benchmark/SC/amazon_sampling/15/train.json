I could play it over and over and never tire of it. Granted it has special memories for me (it came out when I was in college), but there is something about the song...Lindsey's voice, the beat, the instrumentation, all of it combines to create one of those songs that I haven't forgotten in all of these years. Everyone has a few of \"those kind of songs\" hanging around; if it grabs you, that's it; you're hooked, and I'm hooked on Trouble. The rest of the album has a few cool songs and some not so cool. But it was a brave effort on Lindsey's part and I salute him for it. And like I say, Trouble is worth the price.\n"

This hodgepodge comes together on the closer, \"You're No Fun\" (if Steeley Dan and the Ramones had a baby, it would sound like this), which somehow combines over-the-top prog-rock synthesizers and 1970s jazz-rock, capped by a frenetic neo-punk rock climax. This commercial dud doesn't match the grandiose bombastic genius of the band's debut, and bears no resemblence to the pop-funk of their 80's efforts.

Yep, Conlon definitely stayed awake while at Harvard. The man is a walking, talking raconteur and spewer of information.Yet, there is a very good book in here. The stories about Conlon's police work might strike some as repetitive, but what the police do IS repetitive. If they are on the drugs beat, for example, they don't investigate bank robberies. They deal with drugs, day in and day out. So I think he paints an honest picture of police work.Plus, many of his stories are downright hilarious.So, hang in through the early sections, don't be too annoyed by the avalanche of acronyms, and overall you'll enjoy the book.\n"

None of the characters were endearing and it was a challenge to care about what happened to them. Also, in real life, there would be no chemistry between Downey's character and the female lead, Ms. Monaghan. Her history and the reprehensible manner in which she treats him would preclude his devotion (unless he was a complete masochist). Further, and to my disappointment as I'm an extremely politically incorrect person, I found all the gay jokes about Kilmer's Perry obtuse. I really don't think anyone cares about that stuff much in this day and age. Overall, the interactions are too clever by half, and Downey's narration is a bore.

It was done by very laconic but impressive chord play of Jim Hall, accurate swing of Ben Riley. Rollins' solos were very profound, full of feelings. This marks them noticeably from what he plays nowdays. Jim Hall was very young and full of energy and apart from elegant chord support also produced a number of beautiful solos of his own.

I think this is why we are left with incompletely fleshed out characters. The premise of the book ( expatriation from European nobility to American homgenation) has been written before and better. There are pages of beautiful descriptive writing to be sure - Sontag is well practiced at her craft - but in the end we are left not really caring about the stolid, laborious venture through which we've waded.

The author clearly states in the preface what her goals were in writing this book, which I think she does a great job of. However, being knowledgeable in the science field myself, I feel that there are a few flaws in her presentation of some of her research. I think at times it leaves one open to question the validity or the specific correlations of some studies mentioned.Overall, one does get a pretty good depiction of \"medical apartheid\" and it's definitely a VERY scary one! It really makes one question how far we have come from the civil rights movement.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the medical profession, African-American studies or just an informative, interesting read.\n"
