All of the characters were interesting and real, as were their problems. In the first book all the characters were forced to do things they didn't want to: X-Day was meant to be their day of liberation. But X-Day never comes. I hope that the ending of the book is meant to be ironic, that they all decided to adopt plastic smiles like the rest of the world; but the author either betrayed their original intention, or was forced to change it. As for The Last Supper: what the hell was that all about? I'm getting sick of manga publishes just throwing in random stories by the same author just for the hell of it. It was an insipid preachy fable, but at least it wasn't as nearly distracting as when Viz did it in the first volume of \"Boys Over Flowers\".\n"

The bulk of this book is on battle moves, and they have a ton to show you. Everything from chops and punches to roundhouses and elbow strikes is right in this book from many different angles. The only reason I gave this book four instead of five stars is because I really think they could have gone into more detail on the muscle systems, and there are no weapons in this book. Although they show it on the cover, they don't show how to animate your characters with weapons. A small downside, but it still is a great book to learn many different types of action especially battle moves.\n"

The violence becomes senseless gore without empathy or sympathy, and the \"romantic moments\" are reduced to showing of bare flesh in paparazzi style.

My point is that I want to hear the vocal nuances of this talented singer, but cannot make them out.

He originally went to India with a documentary film team.

This could confuse or annoy purists, but one of the things about Stringer that appeals to me is his ability to convey the universal aspects of chants.It's hard for me to imagine what this album would sound like to someone who has not seen Dave's passion in action, but it is both deep and light-hearted, an important contribution to the chanting genre.\n"

Cover of Night was just awful, the plot was way beyond realistic. Ms. Howard must have had enough typed to satisfy her editor or to fill up a specific number of pages because the book just ends with a very hurried explanation. The same can be said for her two books prior to this one. Needless to say Ms. Howard has lost a fan. Don't waste your money wait for your local library to obtain it if you have to read it at all.\n"

Perhaps she will grow into this toy once she walks independently. However, I think that defeats the purpose and description of this toy. It'll sit and gather dust until she wants to ride on it.\n"

I was always a fan of the Holland album and was happy to see that the \"The Trader\" and \"California Saga\" were included. The covers of \"Peggy Sue\", \"Come Go With Me\" and \"California Dreamin'\" are surprisely enjoyable.
