His own success with patents and product development helps him guide the beginner. He takes you step by step through the process in a very precise and understandable way. I am so pleased that I became involved with Bob's teachings early on in my journey to product development. I've purchased other books on the subject and 'From Patent to Profit\" says it best, especially for beginners.\n"

Plugged in (loaded with 4 USB lines) to one of rear ports and several days later the rear ports stopped working. Took to authorized service station and they feel the rear ports were fried due to the laptop ports having to power the Multi port unit. Stated in ad that no external power source was needed and none was supplied (although it looks like a socket is on the MultiPort for one). Price was marked down from 29.99 to 9.99 so I didn't even bother with a return request. Bought a 7 port with external power supply from local dealer and have it plugged into remaining good laptop port. Got what I paid for I guess.\n"

Read together with books like \"Advanced Windows\", \"Inside COM\".2. Very little mention of NT features, for example MaskBlt, PlgBlt, world transformation, NT 5.0 features.3. Bad programming styles, for example, no C++, not much code reuse, every program has a WinMain and registers a class, no assert, lots of static variables which are dangerous in multithreading environment, no exception handling, only single instance of window allowed because use of static variables, no much const where should be.4. Information not fully updated for Win32 API, for example, use RegisterClass instead of RegisterClassEx, spool file name on p. 599; the warning that you should not delete stock object on p. 162 (which is actually safe in Win32);\n"

First off Olevia doesn't make any of the parts on their own (my particular tv was made with LG-Phillips components i know they also use many sharp components as well as some other companies) The only iteam that Olevia does make is the TV case. so when it comes to any replacement (in warranty or not) Olevia is completely worthless.I would suggest to anyone considering buying a Olevia TV is that you just dont. Spend the extra money on a name that will stand behind their product, and one that will have a fair chance of repair if anything should happen in the future. I have spent a year trying to track down a replacement part for my 237V and in that time have failed to find any (Including contacting LG-Phillips).\n"

The color of the batteries does not match the plastic of the controllers, and the stickers on the batteries leave a terrible residue.The plus side? If you intend to use the two batteries together, one at a time while the other charges, then this should be fine, as each battery will last longer than the time taken to charge the other battery. Design is nice, snaps well into wiimote, although quite tight for constant removal and reinsertion.

The winner is the one with three prizes at the BEGINNING of their turn. This makes for a lot of passing and rooting for someone else. I like that.The only real draw-back to the game is that so many prizes are almost impossible to get and usually the same ones get tried for over and over again. This can make for a longer game than necessary. And, if you're playing with people who are not risk takers, the game gets a little slow and predictable.The low educational rating is due to the fact that the game doesn't require that player to do anything but count and remember.Overall, this is a great little game to buy for the whole family. This is not a good game for teens or a primarily adult crowd.\n"
