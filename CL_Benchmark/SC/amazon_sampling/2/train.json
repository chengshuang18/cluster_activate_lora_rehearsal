The bleach smell was overwhelming, even with the windows open and a fan going.I decided to try it on some outdoor furniture that was dirty. It didn't really do much except for killing some mossy growth in the corner of one of the chairs. It didn't make much of a difference on the dirt, even with scrubbing. I sprayed the product on the chairs and let them sit for 10 or 15 minutes and tried again. Still didn't touch it.So then I mixed up someChurch & Dwight Co 51516 Oxi Clean Versatile Stain Removeraccording to directions, and applied it with a rag and let that sit for 10 minutes on both the outdoor furniture and shower floor. It did a much better job of removing the dirt from both the lawn chairs and the shower.\n"

Scandals involving Roosevelt and other older Dems are glossed over without detail. The writers seem to assume that the reader is already familiar with those events. Much focus is placed on the shenanigans of the Clinton White House, which almost seems to be an issue done to death. Vincent and McCain do bring up several Republican wrong-doers to be fair. I think the writers' strongest point is that while Republicans seem to face up to their crimes or at least have to pay the penalty, Democrats very often do not and are occasionally rewarded for them.

I thought maybe her editor gave her a deadline, and she was forced to write a book. --- So, now I read the other person's review and I see that she \"stuck it out\" and was well rewarded for her efforts. So, maybe I'll try it again --- But I hope she or her editor read these reviews and that she NEVER gives her characters such wierd names again, trying to be clever?? because she's losing fans.\n"

Perhaps it has something to do with the relative lack of commercial success of most of these songs. This is sad, as I feel that this period was one of the most creative for the band. \"Add Some Music To Your Day\" is one of the group's best. I was always a fan of the Holland album and was happy to see that the \"The Trader\" and \"California Saga\" were included. The covers of \"Peggy Sue\", \"Come Go With Me\" and \"California Dreamin'\" are surprisely enjoyable. While this material is not as well known as their 60's classics, it has aged very well and stands the test of time. Recommended for all fans of the Beach Boys.\n"
