They are slightly weak on character development--I actually like the dog the best of all the characters. Good action read!\n"

I'm not an authority on Turkish food, but I also sense that \"Turkish Cooking\" is far from encyclopedic. It lacks several of the dishes I've had in Turkish restaurants, including the dessert kazandibi. Bottom line - a nice book for someone interested only in Turkish food, or as a gift to someone you think might like to start cooking Turkish.

And the frenzy of not having them available easily, has added to the madness. But as I learned this morning when we gave him to my 21 month old son- kids may not be quite ready for this Elmo. My son cried endlessly, especially when Elmo bent over laughing and touched my son's leg. He pushed Elmo away and was scared to have him nearby. I was a bit nervous he was scarred for life and wouldn't want elmo again, but once we turned him off and put him aside, he reluctantly gave Elmo a hug. Anyway- bottom line is don't get too crazy about this toy if you can't find it. My son would have loved any Elmo just as much, and probably would prefer one that didn't \"attack\" him.\n"

Once I hooked up the cable to the TV, it produced an adequate image but absolutely no audio. I tried it in each of the HDMI ports, meticulously went through all the settings, and no change. I ended up using the component and audio cables provided by Time Warner with my HD DVR and everything looks and sounds fine. I won't send the HDMI cable back because it's not worth the time, money, and effort. Suffice it to say you do get what you pay for.\n"

As serious theology, or Scriptural analysis, it is weak.For those who want a systematic exposition and discussion of the Scriptural, Historical and Theological bases for Universalism, Talbott's book is far better. Don't judge Universalism by \"If Grace is True\". The arguments are far stronger than this book might lead you to conclude.\n"
