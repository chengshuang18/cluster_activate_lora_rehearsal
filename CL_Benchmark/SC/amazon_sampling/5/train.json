First, it does not come with a \"recycle\" return label like APC has, so you have to flip for the shipping bill yourself. Not expensive, but a bit inconvenient. Second, the RBC7A did not fit nicely into my APC Smart UPS 1500. The width was just a bit wide. It almost seemed that it was slightly bulging on the sides. So the front stuck out just enough to where the front covers did not fit correctly. I had to force everything back together. Lastly, here is where it really lost points for me. I called Tripp customer service about the situation and they treated me with such indifference that they pretty much told me that that's your problem.

Instead of telling an adventurous quest filled with exciting action, this novel was confusing at times for many different themes were introduced at inappropriate times in the novel. Even the format of this book was confusing. This novel was split into two parts, a tale of a man and a tale of a woman. I give the author some credit for writing a novel vividly, painting imaginations into the reader's head. However, I disliked the way that he failed to connect the 'two' stories together. This book could have been better if Charles Frazier concentrated more on the actual importance of the journey itself than the useless everyday events that the characters experienced.\n"

Never seeing the movie \"Field of dreams\", I didn't go into it already knowing the ending.'Shoeless Joe' starts off like most novels, kinda slow. Unfortunally this makes the reader think that it will soon start to pick up and become an interesting novel. This is not so. The story drags on yanking the reader in different pointless directions. I have a book report due for this book tomorrow, and I'm only 3/4 way through the book. I have lost interest in it and have only made it as far as I have because we have to read it some days in engilsh class. Even then I have a hard time keeping my attention pointed to the novel. I always thought keeping the reader interested was a large part of writing a good novel, apparently I was wrong.\n"

Anyway on to \"The Open Door\" I got the bootleg about 3 weeks ago and listened to it off and on, stopping the album at track 7. After buying the album on release day, it's been playing non-stop. My personal favorite is 'Snow White Queen\". The album takes some time to build up, and this where the door swings wide open. Every song after track 6 is everything I'd want Amy to sound like. I'm not saying go on a DL'ing spree, but if you have not heard Origin, try to find it now as it's a perfect compliment to The Open Door.\n"

This is because all of the characters have been upgraded and they all have new moves.As for the graphics. We all know that the ps2 is a graphics machine. And TTT is no exception. As far as I'm concerned, TTT on the ps2 looks better than any game in the arcade, PC, or dreamcast to date.If you want a game that won't collect dust on your entertainment center after 10 hours of gameplay, then I highly recommend you look into this game.

Not that I expected much really. I have been constantly disappointed by these types of releases before. So far the only movie of this genre that has satisfied has been Human Traffic. This one and all others fall short.The problem with this one is that there is no character development. After 40 minutes, you still don't have any interest in them or what happens to them. The movie only gives you a glimpse into their lives for a moment and then you see them partying. Nothing else. Also, the foreshadowing is a bit much here. It isn't too hard to determine what is going to happen next in the film. If you have the money to spend and you HAVE to see it, then go ahead, but be warned that if you have seen any other crappy rave movie, then you have already seen this one.\n"

I gave this two stars rather than one because for a reader new to the period the book at least encapsulates the basic facts and trends. But a far better short history of the 5th century AD - despite its unfortunate occasional descents into religiosity - is Perowne's END OF THE ROMAN WORLD.\n"

I can just see Steve doing his little \"Walk This Way\" shuffle across the stage during the bridge! Some of MY favorites are \"Fly Away From Here\" which was probably 'touched' by an \"Angel\" (Permanant Vacation), \"Under My Skin\", \"Luv Lies\" a song that expresses victory over the pain of love in the fast lane. Others are: \"Outta Your Head\", \"Drop Dead Georgeous\", and \"Avant Garden\" which has an interesting spiritual side. Overall, this band displays more spunk, spice, and spirit after 30 years in the biz than most of its contemporaries. Mick and Keith could take a cue.\n"
