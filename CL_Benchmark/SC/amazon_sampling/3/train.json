One of the very best things I like about it is that it is MADE IN THE U.S.A! the only real con about the buck 119 that I found is that the blade will rust fairly easily. for my uses this is a problem and is also why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars.\n"

It can only be called a cop-out, an escape from the widespread criticism Shutter Island received (from doltheads); what he's done here, in this evocation of early 20th-c. Boston, is sort of an evasive action, it seems to me. Much as I've loved every one of Lehane's earlier works, this one was beyond me -- uninteresting period and place, and very uninteresting characters (with the possible exception of an imagined Babe Ruth in the first chapter). Hard as I tried, I had to give up on page 169. This kind of historical thing from someone like Lehane is like Hemingway doing a Barbara Cartland.................... Please, Dennis, no more.\n"

For example, did Rachel feel any guilt whatsoever when she killed Tom? I would have liked a little more emotion. It also leaves too much out, like what happened to the auxillary animorphs. Did they all die or something? It would be nice to know what happened to them. It was a good plot, a good idea, but it would have been a lot better if it had slowed down, added a lot more character analysis, and explained things more clearly instead of leaving the readers to do a lot of guesswork.
