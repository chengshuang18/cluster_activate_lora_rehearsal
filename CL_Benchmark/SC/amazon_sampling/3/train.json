There are some good tunes on the album notably \"The bomb\" and \"Give it all your heart\" (which at 7.39 is the longest track).It has to be said that this an album for Hancock completists only\n"

This hodgepodge comes together on the closer, \"You're No Fun\" (if Steeley Dan and the Ramones had a baby, it would sound like this), which somehow combines over-the-top prog-rock synthesizers and 1970s jazz-rock, capped by a frenetic neo-punk rock climax.

But even at it's best, the colors are blah and nothing is really in focus. Did they makes this from a VHS transfer or just use lower quality cameras?It's standard DVD format so I was not expecting blu-ray sharpness and color definition. But usually, standard definition video close-ups are sharp even when the audience and wide shots are fuzzy. The video is consistent regardless of scene. I'm guessing they shot this video with 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen) and then cropped it into a widescreen video. Maybe it looks OK on TV, but on a projector screen it reminds me of videos from the early 90's.In any case it's great to hear the music of Journey again.What a high energy performance!\n"

It's not just like using magic to do everything and being in secret from non-magic people. the structure of it is cool because of the way it has two main charaxters and switches views. Since magicians don't actually use magic, (they summon demons and the stronger the demon, the harder he is to control so you need to be a strong magician to control strong demons) Bartimeaus is actually the one with all the power, not Nathaniel (the magician).
