The ability to make it work depends on the features of your car stereo (has auto-reverse?, has a play button?, etc). Ultimately, I gave up because the noise of the plastic gears overwhelmed the excellent audio quality unless I turned the stereo up very loud. It may or may not work in your stereo, and you won't know until you try. So make sure you buy it from a store with an excellent return policy.\n"

After doing a bit of research I discovered that if you have the space it's actually cheaper to buy directly from Bunn. For a box of 1,000 filters (equal to 10 individual boxes of 100 shown here)the price, including shipping and handling, comes down to aprox $1.80 per box of 100 -- which is a bit more than I was paying at Walmart but half the price I was about to pay here.\n"

You basically hammer in the seat cushion to the chair with tiny nails and then that's it. There is no support underneath besides the frame of the chair. I am afraid that one of these days we are going to sink through! The bottom of the seat is very flimsy, too, so you can't really trust it; it's super light with what feels like cardboard with some padding on top of it.
