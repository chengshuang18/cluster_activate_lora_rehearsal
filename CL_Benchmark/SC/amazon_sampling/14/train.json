After six-month use of the wok, I am surprised that it does not change color like any other wok did. I basically use it every day. I only use a kitchen towel to wipe it clean and never use dish detergent or dish washer. The condition of the non-stick surface is just like the first I got this perfect gift!Although its non-stick surface is strong and is allowed any material of utensil to be used on it, I use only wood or nylon type. I believe that using softer material would avoid deteriorating the non-stick surface.I will post a following review if any condition goes worse. Let's see how long it will persist. And by the time, it may be a good change to test their limited lift time warranty though.\n"

The attachment does make it a little heavy on the end, especially if you are a tall person (I'm 6'3\" and it gave my back a good workout). I've been edging with a string BlacknDecker trimmer the past 5 years and wish I had switched long time ago.

This necessitated the removal of the faceplate by \"coaxing\" it off the switch box faceplate mounting screws.
