Nicholas Cage is about 50/50 when it comes to good films, but Michael Caine looked like he'd carry the story in the previews. I couldn't have been more wrong.Cage is a conflicted character, clearly he's unhappy. He's a bad father and his children and ex-wife are evidence of that as well. The preview made it look like a father-son film about being a better father and better man. For every step forward Cage takes, he takes at least two backwards.The sad part is through all of this conflict, there was a tremendous potential for the character to grow, but that never happens. At the end of the movie you are simply left with a feeling that a point should have been made but never was.\n"

The restored footage is fantastic - buy it for no other reason than to hear Cool, Cool, Considerate Men. An outstanding musical number, which of course makes Dickinson's motivations much clearer than in the cut up version released in theaters. There is much more dialogue debating independence, which is most welcome. Also, some rather saucy dialogue concerning the establishment of prostitutes in New Brunswick near the Continental Army camp. 1776 is one of my favorite musicals, and was always a MUST see every July 4, until it was no longer shown in my area. I had to content myself to singing along with the CD of the original Broadway version. I would rank the film version at least in my top five favorite movie musicals, along with Singin' in the Rain, Meet Me in St. Louis and Kiss Me, Kate. You won't be disappointed!!\n"

Highly polemical but that's not its problem; writer didn't have a plot or story in mind so much as an expose. Best bits in the book are the visiting buddhists (who just might be poaching a new Pachen Lama) and the dad's relationship with his almost two-year old son.

Much likeSix Feet Under, Towelhead explores dysfunctional family relationships as experienced through the eyes of a 13-year-old Lebanese-American girl.Many of Ball's familiar themes are present here - sexual awakenings, sexual deviance, abusive families - and as usual he handles the themes with an uncomfortable sensitivity. There are plenty of moments which you'd rather not be sharing with the troubled characters, but the film compels you to watch.The film medium perhaps suits Ball's subject matter better than TV. Where Six Feet Under often threatened to destabilize its credibility with the implausible bad luck that his central characters endured, Towelhead manages to maintain its focus, offering up a tenderly traumatic, and darkly humorous story of Jasira's coming of age into an increasingly sexualized world.\n"

But even at it's best, the colors are blah and nothing is really in focus. Did they makes this from a VHS transfer or just use lower quality cameras?It's standard DVD format so I was not expecting blu-ray sharpness and color definition. But usually, standard definition video close-ups are sharp even when the audience and wide shots are fuzzy. The video is consistent regardless of scene. I'm guessing they shot this video with 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen) and then cropped it into a widescreen video.

I never knew how Quilts were used as codes to direct the slaves to freedom. This book is a real history lesson, that I am so glad to learn about and be a part in helping with the teaching of the slavery days. I was asked by a teacher to make this quilt. She is going to hang it in her classroom for her 5th grade students to make paper blocks, to match the Quilt. The Quilt tells the story. It's AWESOME, and I really enjoyed making it. Thank you Amazon for having this Quilt Book.\n"

There was also a piece of masking tape and a small mark next to the damaged place.These sheets are obviously not first quality, and probably not second quality, either.

It is an overview of the highlights of his life, his career, his performances, and his movies. As a sampler it works well. Interspersed with television performances and interviews, it is a testament to the phenomena that Elvis is and was. The only drawback is that the brief touches of each highlight will only be teasing and never really satisfying. Seeing footage of his army induction, his wedding, and early as well as Las Vegas performances are an interesting draw.(Avoid by all means the companion video 'Elvis: Rare moments with the King,' which is published by the same company, is shorter, and repeats the highlights here. With almost no musical samples, the latter is almost more an archive of only sociological importance.)\n"
