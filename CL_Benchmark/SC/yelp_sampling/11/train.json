The tour started at 5pm at Penn Brewery, then proceeded to East End, Full Pint, and finally Boyd & Bair Vodka distillery.\\n\\nPenn Brewery was cool as usual. We got there a bit early to have a beer and chill at the bar. Happy hour was going on, so 2 pints of beer was $6-- score! The tour started, and our guide gave us a little history about the place in the courtyard. We went back inside and had 3 beer samples (about 8-10oz each), a pierogi and a soft pretzel. The pierogi was delish, and the Penn Dark was the best of the samples. We all hopped on the trolley, and made our way to East End. The trolley is super clean and nice, and we got to do beer samples and trivia on the drive to East End!\\n\\nEast End Brewery is a small operation, and they're primarily a growler filling station. I'll write my review of them, but it's a pretty chill place with helpful, hipster staff.\\n\\nFull Pint Brewery is way out in North Versailles. They're a larger operation situated in a big warehouse. They had 6-8 beers on tap, which you could sample or get full pints (hey, a pun!) of. The Rye Imperial Stout, Perc E Bust, and All-In Amber were my favs. We were supposed to get a tour of the brewing facilities, but for unknown reasons, that never happened. We still had fun hanging out with other peeps on the tour and the locals hanging out.\\n\\nFinally, after a pretty long drive, we ended up at Boyd and Blair. B&B are the only vodka distillery in PA, and they run a pretty small operation with only 4 employees. Despite the size, they've been wildly successful, and it was easy to see why after sampling. They make potato vodka from scratch, and we got a tour of how each step is done. It was great to have at least one educational tour on the Trolley, and the owner did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. I'm definitely a fan! We all got back in the Trolley which dropped everyone back off at Penn Brewery.\\n\\nAll in all, it was well worth the $75/person for the tour. It made for a great birthday present for my hubby, allowing us to meet new people, taste lots of beers, and be safe while sampling!\n"

Same thing with the sweet potato fries-- too soggy, even after I'd requested \\\"extra-crispy,\\\" and not a lot of flavor.  The green chile mac was the only decent item I had.  Back to the burgers, I found it strange that the bacon and blue cheeseburger didn't come with any veggie trimmings (\\\"only the cheeseburgers have them\\\"), but I was given a plate of shredded lettuce and tasteless tomato slices when I asked.  The cheddar cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ#LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ did come with lettuce and, even more interestingly, more flavorful and redder, tomato slices.\\n\\nThe happy hour prices seem like a good deal, and it seems like a decent place to hang out and watch sports on TV, or to just  meet with friends, if hanging out at home, or someone else's, isn't feasible.

The lengua was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nThe service here at Don Jose's was very attentive.  I believe the owners is the man himself and his wife.  They have about 4 sauce selections to choose from.  There was a dark red, a regular tomato/pico de gallo salsa, green salsa, and I forgot what else.  I loved all of them but I'm a huge fan of the green.  The burrito could go without the sauce, but I'm a well known sauce bandit so it was pretty saucey.\\n\\nWith the order, we ordered a California Burrito, Chorizo Burrito, 2 Ham and Egg Breakfast Burrito, and a Sausage and Egg Breakfast Burrito.  I took a bite out of the Chorizo Burrito, it was pretty good.

I also had the del salad with creamy avocado dressing, bacon, and tomatoes. My son had lobster Mac which was one of their sides. It was very rich and creamy, just how you would imagine it to be, son loved it, but too rich for my blood. Hubby ordered the 12 oz filet with peppercorn sauce cooked medium rare.

        "sentence": "Text: Having been a Bikram student for over 8 years, I have practiced all over the world, in more than 6 languages, in studios that were literally days old to those that Mr. Choudry founded himself.  While in Phoenix recently I visited this studio twice, and will give my feedback focused to those who are already knowledgeable about what this style of yoga is like*.  This is really more of  a 4.2 star review, with points off only as a motivator for future excellence!\\n\\n+1 Star - Intro.  I have always felt that a one week intro is not enough time for new folks to figure out if they like this type of yoga.  Two weeks for $20 is a more than fair deal, even if you have to BYO yoga mat or rent them for $2 per day (It seems likely that most own their own mats if they are at the point of experimenting with Bikram so $2 seems reasonable to me).\\n+1 Star - Energy.  The energy of a yoga studio is one of the most important reasons to keep going back.  This place has quite a few loyal patrons.  They keep coming back because they love the teachers and the other folks there.  That positive vibe would keep me coming as well.\\n+ 1 Star - Heat/Humidity.  Just right - not too hot, not too tepid.  I liked it.  I have to admit, I like a lower humidity, too, so while some might complain that this studio was not humid enough, I was happy.\\n+ 1 Star - Parking.  Free and lots of it, as the world should be.\\n- 1 Star - Location.  Next to Domino's pizza? The devil!  Also, rather poorly signaged in the mall, all in all.\\n- 1 Star - Changing Facility (ladies).  I hate to be like this, but I was super disappointed in this aspect.  One shower?  One loo?  Okay, one sink, too, but that was rarely used.  The wait for the shower could get a bit long.  Some folks obviously did not have an idea of how long a \\\"brief shower\\\" is (even though the request is posted on the wall to respect shorter showering times). Also, there are only about a dozen little lockups to put one's things in.  There is a door in the back of the space that leads to the washer/dryer, so the folks doing that have to traipse through the changing room to get access.  It seems to me that the layout was poorly thought out and now it just is what it is.\\n+ 1 Star - Mix.  I like me my classes when there are men and ladies, not just a bunch of uber-babes and my fat ass.  So it was great to see a range of bodies and genders.  There was everything from the smokin-hot \\\"Gumby\\\" girl (damn her and her double jointed-ness!) to a more older Af-Am gentleman (in the front row! you go, bro!), an attractive 30-something paraplegic man (also front row! I love this place!) to the adorable college girls in worse shape than me (they may be young, but all those margaritas have aged 'em).\\n+1 Star / - 1 Star - Cleanliness.  The place did not have too bad of a funky monkey Bikram-y smell.  This in spite of the slightly home-spun vibe of the studio over all (which can often lead to a less than vivid attention to dirt here and there).  The walls are a pasty grey purple, an unfortunate choice of color that makes my mind just think of... dirt.  However, the corners of the toilet and bath area seem free of scunge, the mats appear to be sanitized more vigorously than many other studios, and I did not see nasty icky \\\"what the hey-all is that\\\" on the carpet in the main studio.\\n+1 Star - Retail.  They have a great selection of yoga clothes and mats, which I was pleased to see were at pretty internet-range prices.  Water is available to buy if you forgot it, and of course towels and mats to rent ($2 each).  They do some good deals on packages, too, so be sure to check that out.  I find the pricing competitive.\\n\\nI will definitely come back to this studio when I am next in the Phoenix area, and you will like it here too.\\n\\n*If you aren't familiar with the Bikram style, read the other reviews here and take a look at the website before you go so you won't be surprised/horrified.\n"

The layout of the restaurant is confusing, unorganized and downright uncomfortable.  It's hard to explain but once you order your food you have to wait in this tight, long hallway next to the kitchen where servers run into you to grab food and bring it to some of the tables. At one point the line was so long to wait for food some of the people I was next to had to step outside because it was hot and making them claustrophobic.   Honestly I didn't blame them.  I snapped a quick photo after they had just stepped away which doesn't quite show how tight it was but it will give you an idea of the space I'm talking about.\\n\\n- Quality of my food was less than epic.  I ordered a pick 2 (soup and half sammy).   The most disappointing part was my \\\"French onion\\\" soup.  Normally FO soup comes topped with cheesey goodness and some crunchy bread.   I literally got watery brown broth with onion strips.  Nothing else.       Either they forgot how to make it or ran out of ingredients?  I was in a huge hurry after having to wait so long for my food that I didn't have time to hunt someone down to correct it.   \\n\\n- Napa chicken salad sandwich was dry :(   Not even sure how a chicken salad sandwich could be dry but this one was.

I rented bikes through the Madison B Cycle program; fortunately, there was a pick up location near my hotel. I enjoyed the bike path when I first started. There were many other bikers and runners on the path. However, the smell of the lake was a little pungent. It was a nice scenery, the background was very green with all the trees surrounding the water. There were wake surfers and people kayaking on the lake, which had a nice family feeling to it. I was told that the bike path around the lake is approximately 13 miles. As I was riding, I noticed that the paths started to split. I followed other bikers, but lost them because I couldn't catch up (the rented bikes were single speed compared to the actual professional cyclists). About half way through, I noticed I was no longer following a bike path. Instead, I was riding through residential streets, including 2 very steep hills (not easy on a single speed bike). I was pretty much lost for an hour, riding around the streets. Unfortunately, I was running out of cellular service, too (t-mobile needs to extend their services out there). Without any way of finding a map, I used the lake as a guide. I knew I'd end up where I started and won't be lost if I can see the lake. Soon enough, I made it back safely. I'm giving this 3 stars because the paths were a little misleading. I would recommend this to anyone who is traveling with a partner. The distance is short so it's a good work out, but not totally pushing the limit. However, if you're not familiar of the location, you may get lost.\n"

Your Mom's Donuts delivers and just opened their storefront a couple weeks back.  I stopped in yesterday and they were just about out of everything but we managed to try the french toast with peach jam and the lemon curd with blackberry compote and the vanilla glaze.

They use local ingredients and they switch up the flavors daily.  They have flavors with coconut, bacon, banana, chocolate, etc.  So good.  They also serve coffee and have a few tables in case you choose to dine-in.  \\n\\nWe were told that 4 donuts is $14 but 6 donuts is $15.  So, you do the math.  1/2 a dozen is the way to go and don't act like you can't figure out what to do with that many donuts.  Call me and I will help you out if needed.\\n\\nLove that they are on Monroe Road---we need more things on the East Side/Matthews.  They are open daily from 7am-3pm except on Monday's.

We sat at a cozy 2 top at the far end of the (relatively small) dining room, just beside the end of the bartop. \\n\\nThey offered some complimentary sparkling wine (cava) because it was our anniversary, it was nice to start off with a toast! \\n\\nPosh's concept is all-tasting menu, all the time and you do not know what you'll be getting, it is the Chef's choice. I LOVE TASTING MENUS! Absolutely my favorite thing - I could eat little food forever and be completely happy as I prefer lots of small bites of different interesting things over a gigantic steak/starch/vegetable plate. So, this restaurant is really made for me. In lieu of a menu, you get a sheet where you cross off any proteins you aren't interested in and let the Chef know about likes/dislikes. \\n\\nWe started off with an amuse bouche of a sorbet with basil. It was crisp and refreshing.\\n\\nMy first course was a play on a caprese - tomato sorbet, tomato \\\"pate\\\", basil leaves, a balsamic reduction, and a few shavings of cheese... this dish was okay. The presentation was beautiful and the elements tasted good, but there was way more tomato with just a few scraps of cheese and then these huge basil leaves. \\n\\nThat said, my husband's dish, which was a seafood soup, was AMAZING! It strongly reminded us of a delicious \\\"she-crab\\\" soup that we had had at an upscale \\\"low country\\\" restaurant in Vegas (now closed, sadly) \\n\\nMy second course was Littleneck clams with a shiso broth, eggplant, and shishito pepper. My husband had shrimp that were delicious as well. \\n\\nThe next course was softshell crab - it was pretty simply presented (I honestly can't even remember what came with it) The legs were the best part as they were crispy! It was a bit funny because the server described the crab by saying that \\\"HE is served with\\\"... made me a little sad to eat the little guy :) \\n\\nI had braised pork cheek for the next course, which was hands down my favorite course of the meal - super savory and flavorful. My husband had fried sweetbreads, which he said were a bit overdone - he didn't get much flavor other than \\\"fried\\\". \\n\\nWe had a fish course, which was okay - he had seared ahi tuna, I had a flaky white fish (cannot remember the name!!) \\n\\nOur meat course was interesting - hubby had the kangaroo prepared with ginger sauce - it was definitely a tougher meat, which is to be expected considering the animal. The flavor was sweet and very unique. It reminded me of elk or venison. I had the New York Strip served with a risotto. The steak was tasty but a VERY small portion 2 slices of 2\\\" x 1/2\\\" x 1/4\\\" (remember, I like small portions! This was just a bit too small -when you are serving wagyu or kobe beef that are very rich with fat, it makes sense to serve a tiny portion, but with regular beef, there's not a good reason to be so skimpy!) \\n\\nThe desserts were just okay - a dulce de leche flan and a white chocolate mousse with a raspberry gelee. They tasted well enough, but they weren't really up my ally texturally - both were very mushy and neither had anything crunchy/crispy/cookie-y with them. \\n\\nI ordered a mocktail at the start of the meal - a fruity pomegranate soda. It was good - very sweet, but good. However, one of my first dishes included a garlic chip, which the server had described as a sunchoke chip. I took a large bite of it, and while I don't mind garlic, it meant that I was tasting garlic for the entire rest of the meal! I had a hard time drinking the very sweet soda as it didn't combine well with the garlic flavor. Also, a warning - three of our dishes included garlic chips of some sort. \\n\\nNow, this last bit will sound nitpicky and weird, but it totally impacted my experience: the silverware is really BIG! This made it difficult to compose dainty bites with various elements from the dishes, and was especially weird considering how petite the food is in general. \\n\\nSo, all that said, I did really enjoy our meal! It is a lovely restaurant and the service was great! The food was pretty good and the surprise of each course made it lots of fun. We've had tasting menus in many upscale restaurants and I feel like Posh's pricing makes it a value - a similar length menu at one of the nice restaurants in Vegas would run $100 or more.\n"

This is a nice treat for the kidies and yourself as well! Classic flavors like Jamoca Almond fudge, mint chocolate chip and old fashioned butter pecan never fail! But if you are in an adventurous mood, you can always try out the new flavors they are always coming up with like spider-man 2 and cotton candy, and the great thing is that you can always taste before you buy! One point that needs to be improved on though is cleanliness and customer service, the employees need to smile a bit more :)\n"

They even have a salon and location to eat inside! \\n\\nLifetime has classes from yoga, to zumba, to even kickboxing. I recently took a yoga class and was impressed with the instructor. She pushed up to the limit and even went over the 60 minute class session.\\n\\nAlthough I do pay more than the standard gym fee, I feel it's worth it. You don't have to wait for a machine, you can change up your exercise routine, and know that the location and equipment is clean and well taken care of.\n"

The best features of the gorgeous rooms include:\\n\\n- most comfortable bed I have ever slept in with the most amazing pillows too; I really need to call the hotel to ask them where I can buy my own!\\n- great technology that allowed us to control all the lights, and the curtains, and the room temperature, music, and even the \\\"do not disturb\\\" light from a touch screen remote beside the bed\\n- coolest shower/bath set-up ever - the bath tub was within the big square glass shower which was fun to play in and create an \\\"infinity bath!\\\"\\n- when we ordered champagne to our room, they also suggested chocolate covered strawberries which were delicious!\\n\\nAlso, the hotels restaurants were great. There are lots of super options though they are a little pricey. We loved Jean Georges, the Patisserie, and Lemongrass (basically everywhere we tried!) and the others all looked good too.\\n\\nThe colors of the casino are a bit gloomy with a lot of brown and the fact that the Craps table took a lot of money from us made it feel even gloomier. The dealers did not seem to be Vegas's \\\"A Team\\\" either... I'd rather go elsewhere to gamble but here to stay!!!\\n\\nThe entrance and waterfall are gorgeous too - you should check out City Center even if you are not staying there!\n"

The only reason I booked Bally's was because we had stayed there years ago & it was totally different. No refrigerator or coffee maker.  The sheets were scratchy. The room was old but clean. At checkout the lady at the desk was yelling at the customer in front of me & almost came across the counter at him. I won't be back because there are other hotels.\n"

Either way, I know that it was good - we got an appetizer of dips to share and then I had some sort of pita sandwich that was really excellent. Beer selection wasn't half bad. I had a Peroni and someone else was able to order Moroccan beer (who knew?!). \\n\\nThe best part was our server - Laura, I think. She was fantastic. And the really faint smells of hookah trickling in from the room next door. Hookah and hummus - what more could you want from life!?\n"
