        "sentence": "Text: This midwest chain recently opened in the new Downtown Summerlin complex. It claims to be chef driven -- and maybe it is -- but the quality and execution is on par with similar chain restaurants. The duck confit flatbread ($15.95) was one of the more interesting sounding dishes, but there wasn't enough duck to balance out the sweetness of all the fig marmalade. The lemon garlic wings ($13.95) were huge, but the heavy lemon flavor made them unappealing. The Crave burger ($13.95) wasn't bad. It's a simple burger made up of an angus patty, smoked cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion and their signature burger sauce. The undercooked and under seasoned patty were the only thing holding it back from being a decent burger. Desserts fared much better. Although for someone with a sweet tooth like mine it's tough to screw up chocolate cake ($7.95) -- five layers of dense, moist, sweet chocolate cake. It was, however, lacking a sufficient amount of the orange creme anglaise mentioned on the menu. The S'mores brownie ($7.95) had some enticing elements like the chewy brownie and the marshmallow ice cream, but the amount of torched marshmallow topping the brownie was overload.\\n\\nWith so many other places in town to try, I'm not sure I'll return. Sure, they have a large menu, which also includes sushi but the combination of that and American food in the same restaurant is an even bigger deterrent to my return.\\n\\n2.5 Stars\n"

They gave us hot tea and hot towels and were told to wait till a room was available. We sat at the Tea Lounge and shared a Pellegrino. Other patrons in the lounge were ordering afternoon tea which looked pretty good. The menu had a multi-layered chocolate cake that seemed pretty decently priced at $12 or $15. Too bad it was only available after 5pm. =(\\n\\nAfter waiting for a hour or so, the room was ready and the lady at check-in took care of our bill. It was just water but it was nice of them. The rooms are downstairs while the lobby is on the 23rd floor. The lady walked us to our room. We had the Mandarin Executive Room which was spacious and very modern. I might put some pictures up if I ever get around to it. She quickly explained everything to us before leaving. \\n\\nThe bathroom was extremely nice with a a HUGE soaking tub and a closet shower. There are only 2 negative things I would say about the bathroom is that the small television in the side mirror wasn't working too well. It was really difficult changing channels and we couldn't get the volume to work but we didn't care enough to call concierge and have them fix it. Also the lights in the shower wouldn't turn on sometimes. There were plenty of towels and had any toiletry needed. They had a sewing kit, comb, toothpaste/toothbrush, shower cap, extra soap, a loofah, shoe shining kit, and the best lip balm ever-- better than Khiels!! Too bad there was only one because my friend took it. \\n\\nThe bed was nice, not as soft as I'd like though. Perhaps the sheets were a bit too stiff but they were all new. \\n\\nTurn-down service entails a bottle of water. The coffee/tea pot was filled with water and the complimentary box of teas was extremely nice. The same tea bags sold at JP Patisserie. There were also bath salts if anyone chose to take a nice leisurely bath, just don't fill it up too much or you'll be floating in it. lol\\n\\nPlenty of upscale Vegas hotels are turning hi-tech using remotes for curtains & blinds, music, temperature, and lights. My friend didn't like it because he thought it was slow and unresponsive at times; and it was no match to his system at home. He thought there were better systems out there like any Creston or hi-end Pronto. Mind you, we are well aware that this is still one of the best remote control systems that you can get at a hotel. The same system is also at the ARIA but without the sound bar.\\n\\nWe only stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 2 nights, the rest was spent at the ARIA which doesn't even come close to MO's quality of service. So far the best hotel in Las Vegas but I have yet to stay in the Skylofts, maybe next time.\n"

TWO!!! DOLLARS!!!) tacos were excellent as well.  I tried one of each taco - they offer steak, pork, fish, and seasonal veggie.

This is an almost airy roll of what must have been a cheese batter - I wonder what one would have to do to get a demonstration of how that thing was made - that looked fairly delicious, from my point of view.  The guac was quite tasty, although I don't know that I would call it the best I've ever experienced.  I enjoyed the salsas that were offered nearly as well.  The chips were a slightly thicker variety, with a great fresh crunch and good flavor of their own.  \\n\\nThe service was a bit hectic - our waiter had some help that seemed to come at random times and I wasn't totally sure they were helping him out as much as confusing everyone.  Given that it's a new restaurant, apparently a waiter was out for some reason, and the fact that nothing actually offensive or problematic occurred, I won't dock stars, but I expect this aspect to improve on my next visit.

I wanted my small papillon to get a bath and a trim. Well she then wanted to sell me on the spa package with scents and other junk. I know I have a small little designer dog but he was a rescue and has very sensitive skin. So I just said no. He just has sensitive skin and needs the oatmeal shampoo. Well then I decided to get his nails trimmed and ended up having to buy that package because it was cheaper and they brush their teeth too. I was all good about it, he had never been to the groomers because I am a do it yourself person. He needed the cleaning after the winter.\\n\\nSo I dropped him off and she said since you are doing all that 3 hours. I will call you, and I walked out at 1045 am. So I had to go to work at 1 and he still wasn't ready. I called and just asked if I could come down and pay and my mom would pick him up when he is done. So I did and then gave them my moms contact number.\\n\\nWell I noticed at 5 pm that I had received no information, so I called my mom and said did you pick him up? No, OK well then have they called? She said no. So I called and spoke with the and they said oh we have just been so busy give me an hour. So my mom comes in at 530 pm because it is just ridiculousness to have a dog who simply needs a bath and scissor cut and a nails clipped to be there more then 4 hours let alone 8. Again we where told no not yet. So finally at 615 pm he was done. He went all day no water! no food!! no pee breaks!!! \\nThis was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AT ANY PLACE!! What made it worse was that this was my first grooming experience, I mean I know its Petco but I work for a major retailer too live up to some sort of company expectations.\\n\\nSo all in all I would give it a 0 if I could.

I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\\n\\nDelmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\\n\\nThe Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\\n\\nLuckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\\n\\nThe online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.\n"

Although I definitely would suggest going to this location, definitely has the best inner city vibe around.\\n\\nWhenever friends or family visit Pittsburgh, they always want to visit Pirmantis and I agree.

Like most people, I love to have that first cup of coffee in the morning to get me going. But I also like to have a cup in the evening sometimes as well. We are not limited to the same old coffee flavors anymore; in recent years there has been a real jump in the numbers and kinds of flavored coffees available. I think that the best selection of flavored coffee can be found at Starbucks, which has become one of the best-known coffee brands in the United States. Of course, their reputation was built on their quaint little coffee shops. Unfortunately, these shops are limited in number, and many of us have to settle for a tiny coffee bar in our local Barnes and Noble store. The company has recognized the value of its' brand, and has branched out by selling their product at major grocery stores and on the Internet. Starbucks online is a nifty place to shop for this unique Seattle product, whether for yourself or for gifts. \\ni really enjoy going to this Starbucks. The barista women there were so friendly and they definitely acted like they actually cared about how my day was going. We had casual chit chat ask where i am from and the service was very quick and above average. The drink mocha frap no whip was prepared exactly like i asked.\n"

It looked busy outside on the patio so I figured this must be a pretty decent pizza place. I have only been to one other Fox restaurant and that is True Food Kitchen, which I like a lot. This place..... meh.\\n\\nWe walk in, and the first thing I notice to be different is its not a sit down, order, and food is brought to you kind of place. Its a order at the register, wait for food to come out kind of place. Which I was not expecting and frankly it confused me. The prices were extremely high for this kind of establishment. We ordered a few different items. The portabello and artichoke bruschetta, $4.50. Was it worth the money? No way. It was one thick slice of bread spread with a thin layer of goat cheese, topped with a minuscule amount of peppers, artichokes, and hardly any mushrooms. It did taste good, but definitely not a good value for the money. We also ordered the portabello and artichoke pizza $9.75, as well as the mushroom and arugula pizza, $9.75. I don't know where this place gets off charging the amount of money they do for how little food they give you. Their pizzas are a thin crust, with a thin layer of sauce, and a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Do people actually come here on a regular basis and pay this much for such a thin pizza? If they do something must be wrong with them. Either that or they are so dazzled by the Fox name that they don't care where they throw their cash. Now don't get me wrong. The pizzas all tasted really good, but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here, which is the only reason for the two star review. I don't just review taste, I also review value. And the value here for what you get is none. \\n\\nAlso, places like this that don't pay their employees at least minimum wage really bother me. At the register you pay and they have a tip line. I don't usually tip at these kinds of places where all the service I get is food being brought out to me or if I do I don't tip the usual amount, but I was so flustered by this I had no idea what to do. I even asked the girl do people usually tip, and she told me they were tip based pay employees. Seriously? They don't do anything worth the tip. At that point I felt obligated to tip so I did. And I still feel like I shouldn't have. All in all I spent $34 dollars on about $5 worth of ingredients. I wont be back.\n"

It took 35 minutes to get two burgers and an order of sweet potato fries to the table - cold.  The burgers were absolutely nothing special - except very expensive.  The ground beef was fresh but had sat out long enough not to be even luke-warm. Fries were stone cold.  Something I love: $9 for an order of cold fries.  Service was stretched.  Absolutely nothing special about the burgers or BurGR.  Easier to walk a block down the street to get a hot Quarter-Pounder at McDonald's.  You won't get quite the amount of beef but it will be hot and less than an third the price.  You won't be paying for the fancy curved flame wall at the entrance.  While BurGR is less expensive than other casino eateries, it is still in the category of taking your money for little in return.  Try a Big Mac - you and your pocketbook will be happier.

We called and made a reservation, and I was very excited.\\n\\nFirst strike: I called early in the day to make a reservation for 8 people at 6:30 PM. I called several minutes ahead of time as a courtesy to let them know we would be arriving shortly (because it was a Friday night and I wanted to know if they were on schedule). I reiterated our number of guests and the time. When we arrived, our table was set up for the wrong number of people, and the table they chose was completely impractical for the special needs of some of our guests (which were divulged over the phone both times). There were 5 other tables dining in the restaurant. FIVE. There was no reason, especially after my phone call, that this should have happened. We waited around for changes to be made, which took longer than it should have. However, since we're all human, I shrugged it off and got ready for my meal.\\n\\nSecond strike: We ordered drinks, and I can safely say they were the worst drinks we've ever had. Not one person at our table enjoyed their cocktail; they were overpriced, contained almost no liquor, and were improperly mixed. We stuck to (very overpriced) beer for the rest of the night.\\n\\nThird strike: When it came time to order dinner, we asked the waiter about some of the items on the menu. He seemed to know what 3 of the dishes were, and when we asked him some opinion questions, it became obvious that he only told us to pick these dishes because he was able to pronounce their names. He had NO clue what he was talking about, and we decided to take our chances by ordering a variety of dishes. I also ordered the shrimp cake appetizer.\\n\\nFourth strike: I waited for said appetizer for 40 minutes. In that time two more tables arrived, but three left. Our waiter did not offer refills or check on our table while we waited, and by the time my appetizer showed up, I was about to start eating the basket the bread arrived in. They came closer with my plate, I could hear angels singing, and as soon as they set it down I deflated. I had two silver dollar sized cakes with an extremely large amount of greens on my plate. My husband and I each got three bites between the two cakes, and they were very small bites. I paid $10 for this?\\n\\nFifth strike: Our meals came out within 5 minutes of our appetizer (sigh), and again the portion sizes were disappointing. My steak was cooked appropriately, but it was the only one at the table that was cooked correctly. My husband ordered the lamb shank, and it was tough and poorly seasoned. My mother in law had the lasagna, which was cold. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my sister, who ordered roasted chicken.\\n\\nBetween the poor service, the inability to honor our reservation properly, the awful drinks, the long waits, and the bad food, I'm amazed that this restaurant is so well reviewed. The amount we paid for this awful meal makes it twice as bad. I will definitely never be back to this restaurant. The fact that there were less than 10 occupied tables at what would normally be the dinner rush on a Friday night speaks volumes, and now I know why.\n"
