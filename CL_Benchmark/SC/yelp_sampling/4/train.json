They are beautiful and quiet and they rarely have families or children there.  The casinos are large and open and lovely.  \\nThe rooms are large and beautiful and the hotel staff is amazing.  From the front desk to the concierge to the cleaning people, exceptional. \\nFrom the second you check in they call you by your name, and when you need something at the room they are on it. \\nI like that the hotels are at the other end of the strip from places like the MGM which has gone so far down hill and hosts so many children than I can barely stand to go there anymore, even to the casino. \\nThe casions at Wynn and Encore have such a great filtration system that you never smell the smoke at all.\\nThey have great restaurants, great booze, wine and weight staff including the cocktail waitresses. \\nI agree with some of the other reviews that they could use a few more tables for gambling, like Pai Gow, but I think as they become more popular and the economy rises they will do this. \\nThe other thing we dont like is the resort fee and that the resort fee does not include using some of the facilities like the weight room and the spa area.  To me if I pay the resort fee than it should give me the priveledge of these areas.  Otherwise you should either up the price of the room or end the resort fee all together, its just obnoxious. \\nIts nice that they comped us our meals because we spent so much time at the tables gambling and they were super nice about it all.  \\nSo all in all we always have a great experience at these two hotels.  It can be pricey if you go at high times but sometimes you can get some pretty good deals.  \\nI highly recommend staying in these two resorts.\n"

Was told to sit anywhere I'd liked, so I sat at one of the tables near the windows overlooking the Ice Den, the ice-skating rink next door-- pretty cool. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw#3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw  There were booths alongside one wall that had their own flat-screens, which were nice touches, and an area with leather (or was it pleather?) seating, and yet another flat-screen, which looked inviting.  \\n\\nThe young female server wasn't particularly enthusiastic or helpful about the menu offerings, but was honest enough to steer me away from the sweet potato fries when I inquired about them.  I have to agree with her that the green chile mac 'n cheese was the better option out of the two.  After studying the menus for many minutes, debating on trying three courses (app, entree, and dessert), or just two main entrees, and finally decided on ordering the Bacon and blue cheese burger, with green chile mac to start, and then later on going with the cheeseburger (cheddar) and subbed sweet potato fries for an extra $1.25.  (Perhaps she's not a sweet potato fry fan, or maybe she is and she didn't like the way they were prepared here?  I had to find out for myself.)  The burger patties weren't of high-quality-- I found them consisting of more fillers than meat and too fatty, yet not very flavorful.  I had a bit of the blue cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ#KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ for lunch at work the next day, didn't enjoy it, and threw away the rest of both burgers that night.  Same thing with the sweet potato fries-- too soggy, even after I'd requested \\\"extra-crispy,\\\" and not a lot of flavor.  The green chile mac was the only decent item I had.  Back to the burgers, I found it strange that the bacon and blue cheeseburger didn't come with any veggie trimmings (\\\"only the cheeseburgers have them\\\"), but I was given a plate of shredded lettuce and tasteless tomato slices when I asked.  The cheddar cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ#LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ did come with lettuce and, even more interestingly, more flavorful and redder, tomato slices.\\n\\nThe happy hour prices seem like a good deal, and it seems like a decent place to hang out and watch sports on TV, or to just  meet with friends, if hanging out at home, or someone else's, isn't feasible.

We are beer nerds so it makes for a lovely surprise that a unassuming Bistro would have such an impressive drink menu. The BF wasn't sure of what, and our server (I think possibly the owner) asked what kinds of flavors he likes and gave a few recommendations. I always appreciate a place that knows what they sell since it seems most people don't care about beer the way they do of wine. The BF took his suggestion of a Augustjn Abbey Ale ($7) and I had a Troubadour Obscura ($7) which the guy poured into TULIPS with care to produce a proper head! I had a nerd moment that they had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our drinks as much as we do. He treated it like a sommelier would a fine wine. \\n\\nWhile we waited for food we were served papadam with a tamarind chutney and a cilrantro mint chutney. All really finely made. \\n\\nFor food we really couldn't decide to we went with a Indian Sampler ($30). It doesn't look like a lot of food, but we were both comfortably full.\\n\\nIt includes:\\n\\n*chicken tikka masala- this was a lovely tikka. I've had a lot and this was one of the better ones I've had. Very robust, but balanced. The BF loved this and raves it's the best curry he's had and he had a foodie moment (aww, I think us Yelpers are getting to him...maybe he'll change his mind about doing reviews one day). \\n\\n*lamb vindaloo- the lamb was very tender and the sauce complimented it very well with a bit earthiness, tangyness and a tad spicy. \\n\\n*tandoori chicken- crisp and nicely spiced outside, juicy inside\\n\\n*mixed veggie curry- had a good mix of cauliflower, zucchini, beans, peppers. The curry had a very light and fragrant flavor to it...I can't quite place the spices, but I liked this. \\n\\n*chef choice of lentils- today it was daal. I like daal since it's earthy and comforting. \\n\\n*we got yoghurt, basmati rice, and garlic naan as well. The naan was pretty noms here. \\n\\n*Khir came with it for dessert. It's a rice and milk porridge with raisins, nuts and cardamom according to the menu. When I was eating it, to me it tasted more flowery than just cardamom, like possible orange blossom water was added. It's the kind of light dessert that would be amazing for a hot summer day since it's served cold and has such bright flavors.\\n\\nWe also ordered another dessert that I thought I had and loved at another restaurant and at friends house but haven't come across it in a while. Turns out it was what I was looking for! \\n\\nLal Mohan ($2.99) the description says it's served cold, but it's served piping hot! It's these round pastries that are fried so the outside is crisp and the inside has a creamy kind of dough. They throw it into syrup and it absorbs it so it flavors it throughout.They come 3 to a serving in a shot glass, balls are about gumball sized so you don't get much of it, but it's quality. It's a comforting kind of dessert that would be a good for people who like fried mochi with honey, warm donuts, zeppolis, beignets. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and helpful. I like the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates. Utensils were impeccably polished- no water marks at all. It felt very comfortable with the warm decor and the good staff making you feel good about being there. I just got a strong feeling that they are proud of this place in the pride they take for the little details. \\n\\nI haven't been this surprisingly satisfied in a long time. The BF was super happy with discovering Indian food and having a food epiphany of sorts about it....days later he's still telling me about the tikka and how he wants to go next weekend. \\n\\n Definitely we will be coming back for a la carte and also the buffet sounds like a deal.

We called and made a reservation, and I was very excited.\\n\\nFirst strike: I called early in the day to make a reservation for 8 people at 6:30 PM. I called several minutes ahead of time as a courtesy to let them know we would be arriving shortly (because it was a Friday night and I wanted to know if they were on schedule). I reiterated our number of guests and the time. When we arrived, our table was set up for the wrong number of people, and the table they chose was completely impractical for the special needs of some of our guests (which were divulged over the phone both times). There were 5 other tables dining in the restaurant. FIVE. There was no reason, especially after my phone call, that this should have happened. We waited around for changes to be made, which took longer than it should have. However, since we're all human, I shrugged it off and got ready for my meal.\\n\\nSecond strike: We ordered drinks, and I can safely say they were the worst drinks we've ever had. Not one person at our table enjoyed their cocktail; they were overpriced, contained almost no liquor, and were improperly mixed. We stuck to (very overpriced) beer for the rest of the night.\\n\\nThird strike: When it came time to order dinner, we asked the waiter about some of the items on the menu. He seemed to know what 3 of the dishes were, and when we asked him some opinion questions, it became obvious that he only told us to pick these dishes because he was able to pronounce their names. He had NO clue what he was talking about, and we decided to take our chances by ordering a variety of dishes. I also ordered the shrimp cake appetizer.\\n\\nFourth strike: I waited for said appetizer for 40 minutes. In that time two more tables arrived, but three left. Our waiter did not offer refills or check on our table while we waited, and by the time my appetizer showed up, I was about to start eating the basket the bread arrived in. They came closer with my plate, I could hear angels singing, and as soon as they set it down I deflated. I had two silver dollar sized cakes with an extremely large amount of greens on my plate. My husband and I each got three bites between the two cakes, and they were very small bites. I paid $10 for this?\\n\\nFifth strike: Our meals came out within 5 minutes of our appetizer (sigh), and again the portion sizes were disappointing. My steak was cooked appropriately, but it was the only one at the table that was cooked correctly. My husband ordered the lamb shank, and it was tough and poorly seasoned. My mother in law had the lasagna, which was cold. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my sister, who ordered roasted chicken.\\n\\nBetween the poor service, the inability to honor our reservation properly, the awful drinks, the long waits, and the bad food, I'm amazed that this restaurant is so well reviewed. The amount we paid for this awful meal makes it twice as bad. I will definitely never be back to this restaurant. The fact that there were less than 10 occupied tables at what would normally be the dinner rush on a Friday night speaks volumes, and now I know why.\n"

While in my possession, someone went up my block smashing out car windows for fun. \\n\\nMy friend (the car's owner) made an appointment for noon today to have the back windshield replaced. I checked in at 11:45. The woman at the front desk was having trouble with the computer, so she couldn't see my name, but saw there was a 12:00 glass appointment and she said \\\"That must be you!\\\" I confirmed that it would take about two hours, handed over the keys, and went to the waiting area to get in some reading. \\n\\nAround 1:45, a tech came over and asked if I'd been helped. I said that I'd checked in two hours ago. He conveyed that he thought it was a drop-off and would pull the car around and get started. SUPER!

He comes back to say that their call center has no record of an appointment there or at the east side location. My response was, \\\"So, there was coincidentally ANOTHER 12 o'clock glass appointment?\\\" He admitted there wasn't. I expressed that I understood things happen and things get mixed up, but what I didn't understand is why no one came to tell me that my car wasn't getting worked on (even if the tech was out of the loop, the person I checked in with knew I was waiting -- shouldn't it have clicked that no one came to retrieve the keys from her?)\\n\\nThe tech and the front desk woman left again to try to figure out what happened. About ten minutes later, another tech came over and explained that whoever entered the appointment (so, the appointment that didn't exist did, in fact, exist) put it in as a front windshield repair. Abra didn't have the glass, and there was no glass in town for them to go get. He also explained that corporate would be calling the shop to talk to me and I could yell at them if I'd like and try to cut a deal. At least he was honest.\\n\\nAfter about twenty minutes, there was still no call, so I went up to the desk. I told them to just call the owner, since it was his car, his money, and his insurance. I didn't see the point in yelling at someone over the phone (they didn't make the mistakes, why ruin that person's day?), and I knew yelling at the people there would also get me nowhere. \\n\\nWhile waiting, another customer came in angry because this was the second time they'd tried to get their car, but the problem was still there. You could hear it rattling outside, and it was smoking. She was irritated that they still hadn't fixed it, and outraged they didn't bother to make sure it was running correctly before having her come down to pick it up. One of the Abra agents claimed he had test-driven it that morning and that it had run fine, but the car was noisy and smoking before she had even gotten out of the parking lot. I'm kind of doubting the test drive happened. Also peeving is that the agent's response was \\\"well, sometimes these things happen\\\" - didn't really apologize, and didn't seem at all concerned with trying to make the customer happy. \\n\\nI felt like I was treated the same way - they didn't seem particularly sorry or concerned that I'd spent nearly four hours there with nothing to show for it. I tried to be civil and courteous even though I had every right to be angry, and it would have been nice if anyone had actually acted like they felt bad instead of just shrugging it off like \\\"oops! oh well!\\\". \\n\\nI unfortunately have to go back because that's where my friend's insurance will pay, but if I had a choice in the matter, I'd most definitely take my business elsewhere.\\n\\n***UPDATE***\\nAnother appointment was set for today, drop off when they opened, and supposed to be done at lunchtime so I could have someone drive me over to pick it up. Again, they screwed up and didn't get it until four. My ride didn't have all day (literally), so I went in with my car to pick up the keys but had to leave my friend's car there - and there it will sit until I can get back over there.

The server, who was nice, advised me you could no longer just order chicken fried rice at the Teppan table. The owner, Barry, said he couldn't sell his chicken fried rice that cheap without ordering a meal. I explained that I was drinking an expensive sake and I had personally ordered $25.00 in sushi. He actually debated with me for about 10 minutes about how he could not make any exceptions and I would have to order it from the kitchen. I advised him that I would pay kitchen price and I just wanted the experience of having it cooked at the table. The owner, Barry, said he would make an exception this time, but when the Teppan chef started cooking there was no fried rice. \\n\\nIn the mean time the sushi started rolling out and it was the most pathetic tasting and smelling sushi I have ever had at a moderately expensive restaurant.

The young lady said somebody has sprayed the room I had stayed in and housekeeping did a thorough job cleaning it. (It takes more than that to get rid of them, but motel staff will have to deal with that )\\n\\nThe second night in the new room was fine. The room appeared just as clean as the last one. I had no new bites from the second night, I made sure to look very carefully before going to bed. Perhaps the bedbugs came from a previous guest and they were confined to that room, I will never know, I don't care. I just know I was bitten many, many times. \\n\\n Checkout procedure was very quick and very polite, no word from a manager still. \\n\\nI will never go back, and will never recommend it.

I could buy the same statue up home in Washington State for 300 versus the 500 they wanted for it. I looked at Toy Biz X-Men movie toys and he's askin' 25 bucks per carded figure. You really can't give that stuff away at 5 bucks, let alone 25. The customer service was fine, staff was friendly but, the prices were overblown amazon.com prices.

That's easy enough, but then you pick lettuce, then you pick the throw ins, then you pick a protein (extra choice, even if you choose a full creation), then you pick a dressing, then you choose if you want it tossed or chopped.  It's just too much!\\n\\nThree is that the options add up (in price) really, really fast.  If you don't like the full creation ($6-9) and go for the junior (approx $2 less), you can easily make up the difference in throw ins - just four will make up the difference in price, not to mention the size of the salad itself.  There is also no simple explanation of size difference (you can ask to see a bowl, but it doesn't really help visualize the difference).  To top it all off - literally - if you want chicken or something on your salad, you're adding to the cost no matter which salad you ordered.\\n\\nThey also have paninis and wraps, as well as soups, but let's face it - you went for a salad, right?  That's like going to Subway for a salad, or ordering a pizza from a sandwich shop.  Hmm.  Guess that does happen.\\n\\nWhat they need is a model more like Subway and less like you're going to get picked to death on every little thing you put on the salad.\\n\\nWhile the quality of the salad itself is pretty decent, trying to figure out the menu board and what goes with what without just getting bowled over (sorry) by what you can order without being taken is too much.\\n\\nThat said, the staff is friendly, and the double-pizza-cutter that chops up the salad is neat to watch - probably worth ordering yours chopped just for that reason.

The place is rather hidden, you have to walk through a little hallway to get to the place, and from what I can recall, unless I was fairly buzz, I don't recall any huge signs showing that it was there.\\n\\nThe pizza isn't pizza hut pan crust, or any of this special chicago pizza that you'd crave from zachary's, just your plain jane new york style pizza.  However, from a night out of dancing and drinking, pizza sounds unbearably delicious.\n"
