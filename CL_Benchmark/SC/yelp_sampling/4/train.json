We had a long trek from tower 3 at The Signature at MGM Grand and we woke up late.  We were gonna try to hustle our booties over to anywhere but here, but we realized that if we walked we would miss it.  Oh well.  Breakfast was a little better, though, since they had more to offer.  But again, the meats were overcooked, dried out, and overseasoned.  OH WAIT! That's because they were serving the EXACT same things they served the night before!  This time, though, they added fluffy scrambled eggs that were weirdly wet for some reason, cheap bacon, and stale cereal.  My daughter did enjoy the pancakes and blueberries, and I enjoyed the time when it was time to leave.  Two stars - one for the friendly staff, and one for the pecan tart at the dessert station.\n"

For a somewhat renovated hotel, it is what it is, and would probably be worth staying at again for the value.  But, since all of us Yelpers base our reviews on the entire experience, let me expand why the Trop only gets two:\\n\\nMy sister and I were celebrating our birthday weekend in Veags (we're twins) and had booked a Saturday night at the Trop via an online deal.  Excited, since we've never stayed there before but knew it was this famous place on the strip, we looked into good food around the area, and what else we can do that was close.  Having stayed at other hotels not in the middle of the strip before, discovering that the Tropicana was much more south than what was ideal, we made the most of it and understood there would be some travelling in the car.  Okay, no problem.  We made dinner reservations further up the strip and booked show tickets at Planet Hollywood.  We were set.\\n\\nWe arrive in Vegas around 1:30pm, and decide to have lunch first before checking in, since it was too early to do so and our lunch reservation was North Strip.  After lunch and some games, we head down a little bit after 4pm (check-in begins at 3), and that's when the trouble starts.  4pm, and our room wasn't ready?  Hmmm, okay, how long, we ask?  About 45 mins to an hour.  Ugh.\\n\\nSo, we take whatever is available, which is a smoking room (we had reserved a non-smoking one), and as the woman is giving us our keys, we hear the party checking in next to us getting keys for their NON-SMOKING room.  What???  We ask, are there no other non-smoking rooms left, even if we upgraded?  No, she said.  Nothing we can do about it... can't wait an hour for the other room because we had show tickets... so we headed to our smoking floor and our smoking room.\\n\\nWhich, brings us back to the beginning.  Smoking room wasn't bad.  Had a bit of a smell but once you get the air going, it didn't linger.  The room was clean and the beds were comfy.  And the HD TV actually had an HD signal.  Awesome.\\n\\nSo, next time, when you book, call ahead to see if the room is ready, and if you are doing things in the middle of the strip, stay closer to where you'll be.  The Trop, as cool as it was to actually stay there, isn't worth the trouble (or the trouble parking in the small garage), and you'll most likely think you're getting your money's worth elsewhere.\n"

The place - This place is a just the right size. Perhaps 10 -11 tables and also a separated area with two very large banquet tables. I can see this place would be busy at dinners and for lunch it was just right.\\n\\nb.  The service - I know I was in a real cantonese place because of the service. I would have to classify it as indifferent efficiency.  However, that being said, I wanted to order something not on the menu and worked with them and they had it and they asked me if it was the way I liked it. Also it was not too busy.\\n\\nc.

Let's get ready to rock it.\\n\\n- Rock Cod steamed - This s essentially a key fish in cantonese cuisine, at least in my book.  The rock cod themselves have rather large bones and is perfect to steam. The meat is just the right texture and when you add the scallion, oil and soy sauce, the smell, the taste, the natural sauce, it is absolutely the best.\\n\\n- Bitter Melon with spare ribs in black bean sauce - Now listen here all, you know you are in a great place if they serve bitter melon. How many people would normally order bitter melon.  If this was served at Panda, it would never be sold. but here, my goodness, it was great. The melon was just right, firm, not crunchy. The black bean sauce was just the right amount ant the ribs were cut to about an inch or so and was perfect!  When I first moved to LV, I could not find this at any Chinese restaurant so I learned how to make it and at KJ, I love it!\\n\\n- Steamed Chicken with Scallion and Ginger - Now I did not see this on their menu, and they had similar items that were fried, but I needed mine the authentic steamed method. I asked the waitress if they had this after I attempted to describe it and she knew exactly what I wanted and they brought it out.  The half chicken order was perfect. Tons of shredded scallion on top of the chicken that had a very thin layer of skin which means, awesome tasting proper chicken baby!  Yep, the best chicken for this is the not so thick and meaty chicken, but the bony rather emaciated chicken that have a wonderful taste. This dish was just perfect and I had to have extra ginger sauce as it was so good. \\n\\nd.  Overall - You know you are in a really authentic Cantonese restaurant when you see the following:\\n\\n- The Shovel Method - Yep, that is right.  You shovel the rice from a bowl into your mouth with chopsticks. You do NOT try to pick the rice up, you are NOT dainty, you are NOT polite.  You SHOVEL the morsels of rice into your mouth.  By the way, no soy sauce on the rice.  When you are eating Cantonese style, you are putting the food in your plate or your rice bowl and the fragrant and tasty juices of the dishes are absorbed by your rice. Much tastier than soy sauce.\\n\\n- The Boney Plates.  Yeah, not \\\"china\\\" plates but BONEY plates. Yep, true Cantonese people love their meats on the bone.  The bonier the better.  You will hear some sucking and some crunching, gnawing and jawing, however, the best visual is a plate piled with bones stripped clean like a piranha attacked it!\\n\\n- Oh yeah, no silverware.  Come on.  How can anyone eat Cantonese with a fork and knife is beyond me.  BTW, isn't it funny to see so many people at other restaurants eating Chinese food on an american style plate trying to use a chopstick?   I use silverware when eating in Chinese restaurants that do not have bowls.  Shovel method.  That is the way to go!\\n\\nGK says, check this place out.

There were many other bikers and runners on the path. However, the smell of the lake was a little pungent. It was a nice scenery, the background was very green with all the trees surrounding the water. There were wake surfers and people kayaking on the lake, which had a nice family feeling to it. I was told that the bike path around the lake is approximately 13 miles. As I was riding, I noticed that the paths started to split. I followed other bikers, but lost them because I couldn't catch up (the rented bikes were single speed compared to the actual professional cyclists). About half way through, I noticed I was no longer following a bike path. Instead, I was riding through residential streets, including 2 very steep hills (not easy on a single speed bike). I was pretty much lost for an hour, riding around the streets. Unfortunately, I was running out of cellular service, too (t-mobile needs to extend their services out there). Without any way of finding a map, I used the lake as a guide. I knew I'd end up where I started and won't be lost if I can see the lake. Soon enough, I made it back safely. I'm giving this 3 stars because the paths were a little misleading. I would recommend this to anyone who is traveling with a partner.

Paper is the king, efficiency is of no concern, and inconvenience to customers is the rule. (Wait, somebody said customers? who are they other than mere *things* whom money should be sucked out of at all costs?). Most of the people who work at the Blvd of the Allies office, the Parking Court, and on the phone have the aura of kings and queens; the aura that governs those who want to be in control and assert their superiority to others who actually need their services. They act as if they would be doing favors to you, whereas they are only supposed to be doing their job. The goal of the whole establishment seems to be not making parking easier for people but doing things such that they can suck the most money out of people who park (and especially those who need to park in the city boundaries) in the very limited parking resources. \\n\\nEnough of the rant. Let's move to some concrete examples. \\n\\nExample 1: I live within the city boundary, so I need to get a zone permit to park in front of my apartment. It turns out I have to renew this zone permit every year via mail. I am happy to pay more to get a 3-year or 5-year zone permit so that I do not have to deal with this snail mail renewing process which is invariably prone to the forgetfulness of human mind. But, you have no choice. You have to pay $20 to renew your residential parking permit every single year. So, what happens? I forget to pay one year because the Parking Authority did not mail me my renewal notice, and lo and behold I see a ticket on my car parked in front of my apartment. A $35 ticket for parking in a residential zone without permit. The permit itself costs only $20. How reasonable is this? A $35 ticket for a $20 permit, which did not get renewed because the Authority did not send a renewal notice.\\n\\nLet's say we accepted that. Now, I want to renew my residential permit online. I am not allowed because you cannot get or renew a residential permit online or even on the phone. You have to be physically present in front of the Authority to accomplish this monstrous task. So what do you do? You go to the Blvd of the Allies office and renew your residential parking permit, for one year. You have to sign documents, bring your lease, etc etc (Thank God some of this information is on their website, even though it might take a while to find.) So, I do that and I ask if I can dispute the $35 ticket I got for not renewing my $20 permit. Of course you can, apparently, but they do not do this sort of business at the Blvd of the Allies office: you have to make an appointment with the Pittsburgh Parking Court, go there on a separate date, explain your case to a judge (don't judges have better things to do in this city? more important problems to solve?), and pray to God that the judge actually has some common sense left in him. Good luck!  \\n\\nTechnology has really not seem to have caught on in the Parking Authority of the city of Pittsburgh -- except when they demand payment from you. If you want to simply renew your residential parking permit online or on the phone or even via snail mail, there is no way. But if they ticket you, all options are there for you to pay. You want the phone to pay your ticket? You got it. You want the internet to pay your ticket? You got it. You want the good old snail mail? You got it. You will get charged a fee for the first two (thank you very much), but you have all the convenience to fork your money over. You just cannot have the same convenience when you actually want to do the things that would prevent you from getting tickets in the future, like getting a residential parking permit.\\n\\nExample 2: They will find a way to ticket you in any way, shape, or form they can. They will not fix meters and not clearly mark where parking is disallowed, just to keep open the option of ticketing you. If there is an opening that looks like a parking spot but you are not sure, be very careful. If you are lucky once, it does not mean you will be lucky the next time. Basically, many spots are not clearly delineated, so you can get a ticket even though something looks like a spot to you and there is no sign saying \\\"No Parking.\\\" They will ticket you. And, if you want to dispute, you are in for some pain. \\n\\nExample 3: To dispute a ticket, you have to go to the court. And, the court has limited hours. There is no other way to handle a disputed ticket, even if the issue is trivial. Actually, there is a way. Their website says you can call a number if you believe the ticket is unfair and if you were issued the ticket for a very limited number of reasons. Apparently, some very limited cases can be handled without going to the court. In theory, they can... If you get an answer to your phone call, that is. Good luck with that!\n"

        "sentence": "Text: Tragically disappointing, unless you enjoy eating raw lobster and scallops.  Outrageously expensive as well.  Details below.\\n\\nWe visited Le Cirque on 12/17/07.  I wanted to take my partner and some lifelong friends out for a fantastic dinner in Las Vegas and the concierge assured me that this was one of the best restaurants in town.  \\\"Five star\\\" quality she said.\\n\\nWell, the dinner was a total disaster.\\n\\nFirst, our cocktail disaster.  We ordered Ketel One martinis, and from our table we watched the martinis sit in the shaker for nearly ten minutes before the bartender poured them into glasses.  When they finally got to us they tasted mostly like water.\\n\\nNext, the appetizer disaster.  My partner ordered the scallops and lobster appetizer.  After one bite of the lobster, he realized that the lobster was NOT COOKED.  Everyone at the table inspected the appetizer and agreed that it was not cooked.  The restaurant manager agreed too, so she sent it back to the kitchen and brought my partner another one.  Well, the second appetizer had cooked lobster but RAW scallops!  So we had to send that one back too.  Yikes.  At this point, my partner declined a third try on the appetizer.\\n\\nBecause of this terrible screw up, the restaurant then decided to bring our entire table free garlic pasta appetizers (without asking us first).  Unfortunately, my partner does not eat fresh garlic, so they had to take that back.  Then, again without asking us first the restaurant brought my partner a foie gras appetizer, which he also couldn't eat because he doesn't like foie gras.  Even though the restaurant meant well by these gestures, they only made the situation worse because they didn't ask us what we wanted.\\n\\nNow on to the wine steward disaster.  When we sat down, I consulted with the wine steward over wines and selected both white and red wine for our table.  Well, the red wine didn't show up until our main course was served, but no white wine -- the wine steward had completely forgotten about the white wine that I had selected!  We had to remind him.  This is not the type of wine steward service that I expect from a five star restaurant!\\n\\nAnd finally, the main course disaster.  Three of our four main courses arrived barely warm.  At that point, my partner sent his main course back to the kitchen and decided to not eat dinner altogether.  I ate my sea bass main course and it was decent but would have been better hotter.  Not one of my dinner guests raved about the food at Le Cirque.\\n\\nSo overall, my wonderful idea of a fantastic dinner for my partner and my two longtime friends turned into something out of a Stephen King novel.  I was very disappointed.\\n\\nOf course, the restaurant apologized profusely for serving us uncooked seafood and for the comedy of errors (especially since the manager witnessed all of it firsthand), and comped my partner's dinner, the watered down martinis and our bottle of red wine.  This was a nice gesture, but even after this, our bill still came to over $400 for four people.  Way too much money for the quality and service at this place.\\n\\nAfterwards, we spoke to the general manager of the Bellagio Hotel, where we were also staying, about this horrible experience.  The general manager took my partner's drivers license number and address in order to run a background check on him, and then promised to contact us the following day about our situation.  The next day we received a call from the hotel's Risk Manager who offered us two free nights stay and free dinner for two on a future stay once my partner signed a legal liability release for the hotel and restaurant.  Yes, everything always comes down to the lawyers!!  LOL  So, the hotel did try to make things right for us as best as they could.\\n\\nLuckily, after all of this, the MOST IMPORTANT THING is that my partner did not get sick from eating that one bite of uncooked lobster.  But it did create one very unpleasant experience for us.\n"

Service was ok. took everybody's drink orders, but mine. One of our friends was hungry, and didn't realize he had to wait for the spiel before he could order. He asked one of our servers if he could order, and he responded \\\"no\\\" and walked away. Lobster bisque had too much flour, flavorless really. Oysters were good, but nobody stopped to explain if they were pemaquid or kumamoto., and left before we could ask. The seared tenderloins were super tough. Filet  mignon was good. Sauteed mushrooms needed salt, the asparagus was overcooked. The only high point of the meal was the lobster mac' n cheese. Absolutely delicious with perfect crumb topping. I did ask to have some of our sides boxed up, and a server accidentally threw them out. Without any questions, they did prepare new sides for us to take - which was really nice, but I might stick to Mastro's instead next time\n"

They have 2 floors, but I've only really stayed upstairs (I hate underground bars). The set up just seems all wrong to me, but maybe I've just been here too late after mayhem has taken its toll. The bar is located along the back wall, & it can be tough to grab a beer if it's really crowded, but that's pretty much anywhere. The thing that irks me is the inability for you & a group of friends to really stand around & talk. There isn't much room to do anything, unless you love standing in really close quarters with your friends. Like I said though, maybe the mayhem of the night has already take its toll & screwed up the arrangement of things, but I think it's mostly due to the setup of the place. \\n\\nBrick & Barrel always has a line with people clamoring to get in, to become crowded amongst other people they don't know. Maybe if they didn't allow so many people inside I would like this place a little bit better, but on a busy night I try to stay away from here. So if you're with a large group of friends & looking to hang out & talk with them, then I'd suggest somewhere a little more open & quieter.

And let's be honest here, whoever came up with their uniforms, you deserve a medal.\\n\\nBut it is the food we are interested in.\\n\\nThe wife went for the Sunday Dinner with roast beef, I had the Sunday dinner with lamb and beef, both dishes are served with Yorkshire pudding, veg and A roast potato (more on those in a minute), along with this my wife ordered a small house salad.\\n\\nAfter a while we had pretty much given up on the salad, no big deal, these things do happen. however, when are meals came out, they each had a house salad on the plate, along with the meat, potatoes, veg, Yorkshire pudding and gravy.....\\n\\nA pet peeve of mine is when waitstaff know that something isn't right, how a house salad, with gravy even makes it out of the kitchen is beyond me (unless this is the way the owners want it, in which case....WOW).\\n\\nAnyways, a quick recovery by the lady serving us, my salad which I did not order is gone and my wife has a nice house salad on the side, which would have been better served before the meal came out, but ok, on to the meal itself.\\n\\nIs it a \\\"traditional British Sunday dinner\\\", well yeah it is, in the same way that as a McDonald's 1/4 pounder is a gourmet burger, all the pieces are correct, it looks right, but there is just something missing.\\n\\nSo let us dissect the meal :\\n\\nThe meats were good, maybe a little thinly sliced, but that happens to be the way I like them, so I was happy, however, putting beef gravy on to lamb just destroys any taste to the meat, if you are going to offer both meats, it's actually better to serve the gravy on the side and let the customer mess it up.\\n\\nThe Yorkshire pudding was good, this is something that normally causes all kinds of issues to those not raised with the darn things, but they were good.\\n\\nVeg is veg, enough said and ignored.\\n\\nNow for the real crime on this dish, the roast potato.....This is going to be long, it is a story and a rant.\\n\\nThe Great British Roast Potato, a food that when done right makes a Brit smile and a non Brit wish they had been born a Brit, sounds like exaggeration huh ? \\n\\nA couple of years ago we were lucky enough to host the family Christmas dinner here, it seemed like half of California showed up, the women folk worked their wonders on the veg, the father in law worked on turkey and prime rib.\\n\\nOver in a corner of the kitchen the Brit who married into the family was hiding in a cloud of steam, gently giggling to himself, these poor Americans had no idea what was about to hit them. A bag of potatoes had been boiled, cut in half and were now being gently rocked back and forth in a colander.\\n\\nThe women were looking at the wife wondering, WTF did you go and marry this guy for ? And why won't he answer any questions about what he is cooking ?\\n\\n45 minutes before we are due to eat, the potatoes are placed in the oven, set at 325, basting in a bath of melted lard and drippings. After 15 minutes the oven door is quickly opened, the potatoes are quickly covered with the oil, 15 minutes later the door is again opened and the potatoes are turned over.\\n\\nSo 45 minutes pass, what comes out is a potato that is golden brown on the outside with a crispness to it while inside the potato is light and fluffy.... And totally ignored by everyone ! Heretics !\\n\\nThat is until the father in law becomes brave and decides to try one of these strange things his new son in law has produced.... Or it could of been his daughter kicking him under the table while not so subtly nodding at the bowl of potatoes, but he tries one, then ever so slowly reaches over and grabs the bowl and shovels a bunch of them on to his plate, the family is shocked, the strange new food is a hit with the old man, the Brit sits back with a little smile on his face.\\n\\nNow the reason for that long story is...... If you are going to serve roast potatoes serve roast potatoes, not two little bits of potato that if I had to guess came out of a bag frozen, were quickly thrown through some oil and then put on a plate and served.\\n\\nYes doing it right is time consuming, yes it can be a bit of a pain, but if a chain in the UK can do it day in and day out serving thousands of meals a day,there is no reason why a little restaurant cannot get such an important part of the meal right.\\nFor this reason and this reason alone they get marked down, is that mean, well no it's not.\n"

Weekends are our only time to be able to shop for the animals together and sometimes it was difficult to come on Saturdays and  Sundays were closed. \\n\\nI'm a big fan of local business in general but I'm very enthusiastic about this place since it enables me to be the kind of pet parent I want to be.

Until someone can point me at a Gyro place that makes them like they do in some of the larger cities in the U.S., or like in Greece or Turkey, where they hand make the meat on a spit, it is lamb sliced thin, and placed in layers on a skewer, then slow roasted, and sliced and served while you watch, then Salonikas will remain the best.  \\n\\nSeriously, every single Gyro place around here just buys that big round slab of processed meat, and puts it on a spinner. Folks that say \\\"Oh it is seasoned so perfectly at XXXX\\\" are nuts.  No place around here makes their own lamb gyro meat. If you know of one, put it down, I want to go there.\\n\\nI like Salonikas because I like the pita, it is nice and thick and chewy, and they fry it on the flat top.  Places that don't heat the pita (like that place on the Strip that sells Gyros for $5 and he don't even heat the pita?!?!) They STINK!  \\n\\nI like the tszaziki (however you spell it).  It is nice and thick and well seasoned.  It does not go running down your arm when you take a big honking bite of your gyro.  \\n\\nI like the meat, it is seasoned so perfectly!  (!?!?!) Actually, they cook it long enough to make it a bit crusty, and they slice it nice and thin.  And they put on a LOT of it.  \\n\\nAnd all the veg is just right.  I wish they used hotter onions, but oh well.\\n\\nAnd best of all, they have a bar, that is VERY fairly priced.  Especially considering it is located so near the theatre district.  I also absolutely like all the other stuff they have, the spanakopata, and the moussaka, and the grape leaves.  Pretty much anything they sell.\\n\\nAnd keep this in mind, this place is inexpensive.  I mean seriously, the negative reviews this place gets all seem to say \\\"the prices are cheap, and tastes it\\\".  Well, bull.  The food is inexpensive, and what you get for what they charge, is way above what you expect.  Like, instead of ground lamb in some dishes, you get ground beef.  Still tastes good to me.  Not as great as it would be with ground lamb, but it keeps the price down, and it still tastes good.\\n\\nMy favorite time to eat here?  New Years eve, or Pittsburgh Light Up Night.  I have been here every one of those the past three years, they are packed, you get to have a gyro and a beer.  It is just a nice fun time.  And considering how busy they are, the staff are all way happier that at some of those pinky-in-the-air joiunts in the theatre district.\\n\\nOh, and the customers are all friendly.  Nice mix of blue collar and cops and folks getting a bite before or after some event in the cultural district.  I REALLLY like this place.  \\n\\nNow, next reviewer who throws down some ignorant review about how some other gyro is better, first, is it a REAL gyro, made with REAL thin sliced lamb, slow cooked on a spit and sliced off fresh and juicy, then PLEASE put the name of the place in your review.  I have tried EVERY gyro spot in the city, and quite a few outside it.  And I am STILL looking for a REAL gyro made like that.  Until then, this place is the best for me.\n"

The southern bean salad was dry and the beans were mush. The pimento cheese app was too salty to eat. The atmosphere and staff were great, but that's not enough to bring me back, unfortunately.\n"

Service was lackadaisical at best.  All their food comes from some sort of restaurant supply company and is then reheated and served.  Not sure where the rave reviews here come from--must be Americans who can't live without food loaded with salts and other preservatives.  Final tally over $40 for two people--no drinks.  I could have prepared a better breakfast at home with grocery store ingredients--and I'm a horrible cook.  Every time we drive by the wife and I smirk and cry out our nickname for this place:  \\\"Crappers\\\" cafe.\n"
