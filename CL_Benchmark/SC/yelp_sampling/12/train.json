A guy came by to take our orders and asked if we were ready, then proceeded to not mutter another word even when he didn't understand what we wanted. He managed to mime out hand signals that let us know to clarify what number or order we wanted. Mind you, the guy speaks English very well. When he returned with our food, we asked him to remove appetizer plates and he literally froze for a second before turning around to walk away without muttering anything at all. Then, when I was standing in line to pay, another waiter decides to take a shortcut between me and the guy in front of me and steps on my shoes without apologizing at all. I was the last person in line at the cashier and there was plenty of space behind me and only a narrow gap in front of me.\\n\\nSome of the best local restaurants in Phoenix thrive because they offer a great customer experience along with their great food. Pho Thanh fails horribly at offering any customer experience. Each customer is simply another $6 bowl of pho that needs to be moved along promptly.

LOVELY. \\n\\nMid conversation, our server appeared table-side with a wooden chopping block on wheels!

The server gently carved the steak, artfully plated it, and so delicately sprinkled some salt and drizzled some olive oil over the medium-rare slices of meat.  MAGICAL.  At some point, we found ourselves slightly confused by the humongous rib that lay so peacefully across a little plate - what to do?  Nothing else to do but to pick it up and savor the flavors of the bone that oozed into the meat.  Don't question it.  DO IT. \\n\\nGreen beans came in a little cast-iron tray -  they too were delightful.  Golden raisins and lemon zest all joined the party.

I saw a sign that it is $9 for any sized dog which is cheaper than a lot of places I've seen. I nearly pulled my back trying to wash my dogs in my little ass stand up shower so it's something to consider. \\n\\nThe business/staff are associated with a rescue; the owners also run Heaven Can Wait Sanctuary and many of the staff are volunteers and fosters. That makes me happy since it's basically full circle of helping out animals: they help them find homes, aid with population issues by offering low cost spaying&neuter clinics, help with feral cat populations, then providing a place for those owners to get good foods and services to keep animals happy in their new homes.\\n\\nAnother plus is that they're open 7 days a week. Weekends are our only time to be able to shop for the animals together and sometimes it was difficult to come on Saturdays and  Sundays were closed. \\n\\nI'm a big fan of local business in general but I'm very enthusiastic about this place since it enables me to be the kind of pet parent I want to be. Good selection, prices, nice staff and business owners with a heart for helping- what's not to like?\n"

For cocktails alone, I'd give Merchant 4 stars!\\n\\nThe food is very good too, and they're definitely not lying about the great ingredients, although I'd prefer a little more to choose from on the vegetarian end of things. I'm a fan of their salads and their toasts (particularly the lavender and honey, although a little more lavender would be divine), and they always seem to have a great rotating cheese selection. The chocolate & fruit plate is a simple, terrific dessert. My husband assures me that the charcuterie meats and the burger are both very good too, although not, perhaps, the very best burger in Madison.\\n\\nI think I'd go with a 3 1/2 star rating if I had the option, but I'm going to round down for the moment and hopefully update later on. Places for improvement: (1) We have one of the best farmer's markets around, so there are a zillion veggies available. More veggie (or fish, even?) options, please! (2) I've heard it's quiet at lunchtime (although I've only ever been for dinner), but if you're there for a late dinner, it turns clubby. I haven't ever seen much dancing, but the dance music gets turned up loudly enough to make conversation difficult. (3) Merchant does seem to get busy for dinner, and their waitstaff is well-informed but spread a little too thin.\\n\\nUPDATE 25 July 2011: Haven't been back yet, so no official update, but the owner messaged me to let me know that they had hired additional summer staff and changed the DJ hours. The DJ will now begin spinning at 10.30 on weekends, which seems like a great change to me, as I do enjoy a late dinner particularly in the summer! So, now y'all can either go for the dancing or plan around it more effectively... thanks, Josh. :)\n"

It was excellent when you actually got some of the prosciutto in a bite. Seems they skimped on it quite a bit. Good flavors overall.\\n\\nMy wife had the scallop and prawn risotto. She loved it and actually could not eat the whole thing. I tasted it and the risotto seemed to be well made and correct texture.\\n\\nI ordered the gnocchi sampler: \\nThe spinach gnocchi was too creamy for my tastes but was ok overall.\\nThe goat ragu  gnocchi I swear was beefy mac straight from a can with some seasoning added. This was the low light of the meal.\\nThe lobster gnocchi was out of this world. I can't recommend it enough. I should have ordered a full serving of this!\n"
