They have NO IDEA what they missed!\\n\\nPiece of Cake was wonderful from the start and they certainly lived up to the name.  Our first meeting entailed looking at pictures, laughing and more importantly, tasting cake.  The steps on deciding were easy and the only bad thing was that we didn't have enough people at our wedding to earn us a third tier.. so we had to cut back one of our options. Sad, sad day, indeed.\\n\\nOur final cake was white almond cake on the bottom (there's just a hint of almond which gives the flavor depth) with almond buttercream and the top was mocha cake with caramel buttercream.  The top layer didn't last through the night it was so delicious.  There was some almond cake left, which we enjoyed thoroughly over the few days after the wedding that it lasted.\\n\\nIt's my understanding that Piece of Cake will remake the top tier of the cake for the 1st Anniversary (way better than frozen cake) but we aren't that far yet, so  I can't say for sure.  I'm looking forward to finding out though.  Yum!\n"

I walked up to the counter and recognized Jenny. We volunteered for a Yelp event the week before. I tell you she's good at sales and passing out Yelp flyers. \\n\\nOk, back on track, she explained the menu to me and I ordered the sesame noodles and the combo bao special. As I was waiting, I was served a duck consomme.. how fancy. Did not expect that at all and it was the first time I've had duck consomme. It was surprisingly good especially with the mini diced carrots. \\n\\nNoodles next, I did not think the noodles was going to be such a large portion but I finished it all, really quickly mind you. It was simple and to the point. I know it's not traditional but I would have liked mine to be really spicy. Nothing like spicy noodles to open up your appetite. \\n\\nAnd next the baos, I had pork belly, duck and vege. Because I'm generally not a bun/white bread eater, I ended up eating the inside and left a lot of bao. Insides of all the baos I had were seasoned perfectly and had great flavor. Of course my favorite one was the pork belly. You can never go wrong with pork belly. \\n\\nLooking forward to my next visit. Hope you are well Jenny and Sheriden.

The rest of the meat was only average and the pastas were dry. The thing that put me over the edge was that the seafood was absolutely terrible.

The resort is very beautiful and we had a very lovely view from our suite on the 33rd floor. \\n\\nThe resort got my name incorrect on the account despite my husband put it on the reservation. My name is Kimberly and they listed me as Kira(?) not even close. This did cause a problem when I tried to charge my breakfast to the room the day my husband had to go to conference early. Luckily I had my Military ID that listed him as my husband because I had not brought a purse with me (no charge cards).\\n\\nThe room has all of these high tech toys, that just never worked right. I wouldn't want them in my room but they came with the suite. If you give me a toy and it doesn't work you just lost points. \\n\\nOur TV located in bathroom did not work for the three days we were there despite turning it in every morning as \\\"not working at all\\\" to the front desk! Do I need a TV in bathroom? Not really but you have it in there so it should work, am I right?\\n\\nThe volume on the living room TV did not work when we got there and they sent a nice maintenance guy up to look at it. The cable had broken off in some black box thingy that provided the sound. He said it happens all the time but he could put the sound back to the TV and they could replace the cable the following day. If a problem can be described as \\\"it happens all the time\\\" then you have a system failure and the problem should be addressed as such. Different cable, different sound box, educate the cleaning staff, or whatever makes the \\\"all the time\\\" stop! The cable might have been replaced but the sound continued to come out of the TV and was at a good level of sound - this was great because after that the sound could not be adjusted with the TV remote anymore. Now this is becoming a bang head here moment. \\n\\nThe light switches at our bedside tables were reversed. I control my reading lamp and my husband' s table lamp. I turned this in as a problem the first day but it was never fixed and I had other things to do than sort out their mechanical mess ups. \\n\\nIt is essential when travel to have a coffee pot in our room. We wake usually very early as we live on the east coast and wit the time difference- we can be up at 6am no problem. They call my husband back and said they have no coffee pots??? really? A resort your size and the price we are paying per night for our room and no coffee pots! Someone should go shopping for a few Keurig coffee pots and have them for guests who ask for them!! That would be a very small investment which would quickly provide a great ROI both in good will and giving the customer (remember us) what we want -coffee if we wake up at 6am. My husband woke at 6:30 our first morning and went to the Skyview suites' lounge and was told he could go out to Starbucks or another coffee place. My husband had his robe and slippers on??!! Who trains these people?! Did he look like he was dressed forgoing out in the main area of the hotel. It was bad enough you were making him come down 33 floors for a cup of coffee.\\n\\nThe casino area was pro-ported to be a special area that even if someone was smoking the indoor air quality would be just fine. I am allergic to cigarette smoke - it was most unpleasant and cigars are always the worse. They should confine all cigars to a cigar smoking area, don't let them just walk around with them. \\n\\nHousekeeping did a wonderful job - everything was spotless. The turn down service was excellent. The furnishing were nice. The bed was very fluffy and the pillows were comfortable. The view was breath taking. The water and apples were nice in the Skyview Suite lounge. I don't drink soda and they had no limes for the Sparkling water. \\n\\nMaybe I am just getting spoiled in my old age but I have stay in as nice or nicer suites for a lot less money. I want coffee when I want it! And in my room, not 33 floors below me. I do not like cigarette or cigar smoke period.\\n\\nThey escort you to your room -this is a frequent comment that people are impressed by. They need to get out more often, most places we stay do this. I am turned off by people who have to try to impress you. \\n\\nI wouldn't stay here again and I won't be back to Vegas.

Okay, sorry, that's an exaggeration and not a fair assessment at all, I guess the correct way of putting it is: the crowd was very mixed.  \\n\\nI'll try to be fair right now.  Here we goes:\\n\\nPros:\\n+ It's at the Bellagio, which is my favorite place in Vegas.\\n+ No cover for ladies, and they always pass out those comp ladies passes like someone giving away free candy.  \\n+ Easy to get in - if you're a girl.\\n+ They play a lot of different kinds of music, from 80s, to 90s, to mainstream rap and hip hop, and house, etc.  \\n\\nCons: \\n- It looks very pedestrian for a club.  Especially for a club in Vegas.\\n- Very bad transitions between songs; left us standing there confused many times.\\n- Mixed crowd. This could be a good or bad thing depending on who you are, but for me personally (I'm 24), when I see groups of people who could be your momma or your poppa, then it's time for me to leave as fast as I can.  But hey, I guess mommas and poppas need clubs too, right?  So, it's a good thing for them, they should have fun too.  This club attracts the same kinds of people who would be able to afford to stay at the Bellagio in the first place - an older crowd.  I just wish we'd known that before.\\n\\nOverall, I had a good time because I always have fun when I'm just dancing with friends; however, when I think about the fact that we were on the guest list for XS that night and didn't go there instead, that makes me say BOO!  Part of the reason was because XS is at Encore, all the way on the north end of the strip, and Bellagio is dead center on the strip, and we just didn't want to walk that far.\\n\\nIf you're the type of person who can have fun anywhere she goes, who just likes dancing and singing, then you'll have fun.  If you're more into the ambiance or feel of a place and would prefer a younger crowd, then I'd suggest Tryst or XS.  \\n\\nBut anyway, the club's decent, though I can say for certain that I won't be back.  \\n\\nBUT.\\n\\nI still had fun. No major regrets. And really, that's all that matters to me.\n"
