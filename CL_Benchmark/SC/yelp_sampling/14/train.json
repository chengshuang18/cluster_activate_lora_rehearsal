It wasn't bad, but for half the price I had the same thing at The Original Pancake House  this morning and enjoyed it just as much or possibly more.  Granted, I could have ordered something with a little bit more imagination, but if a restaurant can't handle simple things then I have to wonder whether or not it can handle more complex items.  \\n\\nThe hummus appetizer we ordered arrived with sesame seed covered pita for dipping.  Unfortunately, I can't say much for the hummus because it was completely overwhelmed by the flavor of the sesame seeds on the pita.  I'm not a fan of sesame seeds, so I took one bite and left it at that.  My companion ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad and really enjoyed it.  He also enjoyed the hummus more than I, but he likes sesame seeds so....\\n\\nThanks to a $30 gift certificate from Groupon, our lunch tab was only $18.00.  (I paid $12 for GC and left $6 tip.)  Without the GC, our tab would have been almost twice as much.  I'll try Terrace Cafe again because I have another gift certificate.

        "sentence": "Text: My wife and I had a chance to attend a matinee showing which offered a reduced ticket pricing and I believe the ticket prices are comparable to other places and not overly priced. I researched reviews before deciding to purchase tickets and many of them lowered my expectations especially the quality of the food and mentions of using office chairs and there was nothing explain what the couples seating looked like. Looking at the seating chart it was hard to imagine what the seats were like because there were no pictures, which made me suspicious; were hiding something? It was common sense to me that the office type chairs must be located at the counter seating (C) and the couple seating were the (A) & (B) selections and they had to be a different style, which turned out to be somewhat accurate. The seating chart has dotted lines leading you to think these were short sections of counters but that wasn't so, in actuality there is a solid line of counters stretching from one side to the other of the auditorium with the office type chairs lined up behind them. The chart also doesn't reflect how much spacing there is between the rows, so for those reading this there is a 5' walking isle behind the office chairs and the couples seating is directly behind that, then the next length of counter space is directly behind those seats and so on. They could use a lesson from how iPic shows their seating charts, like the spacing and layout where the seats are placed along with pictures. The isle walking space was convenient for the servers and people to use, unlike other theaters (including iPic) that you have to excuse yourself as you squeeze through to get to the end isles. The couple seats are like over-sized office chairs but without the wheels and swivels, the center arm rest will flip up and the back tilts slightly, they were about as comfortable as the soft tilting back chairs as some Harkins and AMC theaters have. The VIP (V) seats were at the ends of the rows which don't get the best sound and screen quality and they appeared to be a little softer but because of the location there is nothing VIP about them. \\nNow the food; well I've had worse at theaters but for the price I would expect better. The $10 all you can eat pizza was OK but nothing special and better than heated up frozen pizzas like most theaters have. I had pepperoni first then Italian sausage; both needed more meat or thicker slices as the meat flavor was over powered by the dough and sauce. My wife chose the overpriced Tenderloin Tip entree with sweet potato fries which were warm and soft with no crunch at all and the meat was hospital food bland but good after she doused it with salt and pepper. But if you think about it all theater foods and snacks are overpriced, as Dan Harkins once said in an interview, \\\"I sell popcorn, candy and soda, the movies are included in the price\\\", meaning if they didn't have concessions less people would go to the movies because the price would be so high to pay for the reel rentals. I liked the plastic serving dishes because they were quite, the noise of clinking plates and utensils at iPic drives me nuts when you're used to a quieter environment in a theater. \\nThe bar was well stocked and the prices were about the same as the surrounding pubs and restaurants, if you order beer and plan of having more than 4-glasses order a large picture, they won't mention it but it's a better deal until they read this and figure it out, then it might change. And that's all I have to say about that!\n"

What a sweet deal considering how expensive Japanese food could be.  But actually their menu items are reasonably priced.  We had their gyoza, karaage fried chicken, tonkotsu ramen, miso ramen, and the grilled salmon platter.  All this for under $30.00 (with the 25% off).  The gyoza was quite tasty, but I must say that these were the smallest gyoza I have ever had.  The karaage chicken wings came with ketchup and Japanese mayonnaise dip.  It was good, but probably would not order this again because it is deep fried.  I had the miso ramen.  The presentation of the ramen bowl was very pretty and just like the ones you get in Japan.  The miso broth though could have been more concentrated, but not bad.  My wife had the tonkotsu ramen and she really enjoyed it.  The broth was excellent and the egg, sliced roasted pork and other condiments complemented each other very well.  The roasted pork slices in the ramen could have been sliced a little more thicker.  My friend had their grilled salmon platter.  It came with two pieces of sushi, steamed rice, broccoli and macaroni salad.  She substituted the macaroni salad for the seaweed salad.  She also enjoyed her dish.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the two waitress kept coming around wanting clear away our dishes when we haven't even finished eating.

        "sentence": "Text: I had not been to Kampai in a while when I went for a birthday dinner on November 30th. Imagine my surprise to discover it was under new management (I should have read the recent reviews first). I was a fan of Kampai because it was possibly the most authentic Japanese restaurant in Phoenix.\\n\\nThe decor hasn't changed (which, frankly, could use some refreshing, like the seat cushions in the booths are sagging, but overall, is still quite serviceable and even charming), but the menu has changed radically and now includes an almost encyclopedic collection of \\\"maki\\\" sushi (sushi rolls), most of which seem be to calculated to appeal to western tastes. Think Philly and California rolls (along with Caterpillar rolls, Arizona rolls, etc.). Yes, you can still get sushi by the piece, but not sure if I'd bother, they didn't even have tamago (egg omelet) and the surf clam (both nigiri) we had fell apart. Perhaps they should stick with chirashizushi instead of nigiri. I also didn't think the sushi rice was well prepared or that the fish was properly chilled (it seemed a tad warm). I was not impressed.\\n\\nAlong with the sushi we also had a cucumber and seaweed salad (actually, sunomono) which was surprisingly good.\\n\\nCompliments, however, to the wait staff as they were exceedingly attentive and food and drinks were served with a smile and promptly. The staff is probably what stopped me from leaving too quickly (the staff under previous management was always warm and welcoming and I miss them).\\n\\nNow for the food coming out of the kitchen: Another delightful surprise, it was well executed. It was obvious to me that the tempura recipe was slightly different than previously, but it was well done and not greasy. A few details were off-putting, though, there was no gobo root in the vegetable mix and far too many slices of potato, and this time, pieces of chicken, too, which were a little stringy, I'd rather have had an additional shrimp (the large prawns were cut in half lengthwise and served in individually making the serving seem more generous than it was).\\n\\nAlso since the new management, the prices have risen rather steeply: Una-ju (eel over rice) is up sharply and several other items went up as well. Given recent economic times and the rise in restaurant prices, I'm not sure this is entirely fair, but some of the prices went up rather surprisingly high. It is easy, with drinks, to run to over $30.00 per person.\\n\\nThe new restaurant menu is all over the place: It appears that the new owners have tried to keep the core menu, but other additions make it seem disorganized, as if they are trying to please too many. The new menu has Fried rice, bulgogki, tempura, nabeyaki. Fried rice? And, yes, something like an encyclopedia of sushi rolls (2 pages worth).\\n\\nI went to Kampai because it reminded me of restaurants when I was in Japan. It was not striving for fusion or pan-Asain cuisine, or tons of novelty - a new dish now and then, fine, but was a solid example of quietly typical Japanese cuisine; quality classic food and an intimate atmosphere rather than catering to western ideas of what sushi and Japanese food \\\"should\\\" be or giving into food fads. I was always gratified to see members of the local ex-pat Japanese community eating there. And now I don't know where to sate my addiction to Japanese cuisine. Any recommendations greatly appreciated, as I don't know if I will be back to the new Kampai.\n"

At the suggestion of the waiter/cashier I went with the burger, fries and drink special which cashed me out at ten dollars and change.  Add a $1.00 tip in the jar and the total was about $11.50.\\n\\nThe timeliness of the service from order to eating was very good; however, quality may have been trumped for timeliness.  Once the burger was delivered I noticed the top of the bun was cool (which in this case may have been room temperature since I needed a jacket to dine here).

All burgers start with a \\\"10\\\" rating (10 being the best).  If a burger is served with a  store bought bun, -2 points.  If the meat is a preformed, previously frozen, store bought patty, -2 points.  Cold or cool bun, -2 points.\\n\\nBack to Chicago Dogs........Unfortunately, before I even bit into this burger it had a rating of 4.......but, I was willing to be oooooooed and awwwwwwwed by what was between the sterile beef patty and the bun.  Again, unfortunately I was not.  My mouth met with dill pickles, dill peppers, diced (what I think was) bell pepper, one slice of tomato, and one lonely ring of onion.  If these are the type of flavors that \\\"blow your skirt up\\\" on a hamburger then more power to ya........but it wasn't for me.  Put these same condiments with a fresh ground beef patty and a warm specialty bun, and I may sing a different tune.\\n\\nThe fries appeared fresh cut and were quite good.  Unfortunately, when I grabbed for the ketchup for some dipping and mopping the greasy plastic red dispenser was empty. I glanced at the two tables next to me an noticed that the ketchup dispensers were also nearly empty.  This gave rise to the thought, \\\"How long has the ketchup been in these bottles?\\\"  I ate the fries dry.\\n\\nOn my departure, the waiter/cashier asked me how the burger was.  I mentioned that the bun was cold.  He replied, \\\"That's strange.\\\"  I wanted to offer more of my good information to help him and his business improve on this American staple but he never said anything else.  As I turned and began to walk out I said, \\\"Thank you.\\\"   He said nothing. I guess i hurt his feelings with the cold bun comment.  He need  not worry, I won't be back.\n"
