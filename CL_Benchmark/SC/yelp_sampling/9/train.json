So, if you're looking for a guaranteed \\\"good eat\\\" this IS NOT the place. We are a family of four and were looking for a good place to eat brunch one Saturday morning before taking our kids around town. My sister-in-law said she enjoyed JP Pancake, so we thought we would  give it a try. My son (4) and my daughter (1) were very hungry, and thinking this was a breakfast/lunch joint, the service would be quick. At 10:30am they seated us and our order was promptly taken. The waitress was very friendly and brought us our drinks right away. Time passed and my children grew even hungrier, but my husband and I did our best to pacify and entertain them.  I came to the realization that my daughter was not going to make it until the food came out, so I began to prepare a bottle for her. Not only did they NOT have filtered water but I had to walk out of the restaurant, across the parking lot, to another \\\"fast food joint\\\" to buy a $2.00 bottle of water to prepare her bottle. By the time I got back to the restaurant our food STILL was not out. At 11:30am our food finally makes an appearance. Everything was thoroughly cooked (thank goodness!), however, the quality wasn't any better than IHOP, Village Inn, or Denny's. If I'm going to wait that long for my meal it better be \\\"Farmhouse\\\" quality. The biscuits and gravy were tasteless, the bacon and eggs were saturated in oil and grease.... Pretty much the only thing worth eating was the pancakes/French toast.  To their credit they did offer us a 20% discount for the long wait, which took a whole $5.00 off our bill. When we finally left at 12:00pm, an hour and a half later, I was exhausted! Needless to say we just went home after that ordeal. Thank you JP Pancake for ruining what we hoped to be a fun day out with our kids.\n"

As for me, after having memberships at numerous other Valley health clubs (Bally, Mountainside Fitness, Golds, etc.), after much debate, he finally convinced me to join the Village about three years ago because my favorite yoga instructor (Harmony) teaches classes there. Yes, the Village is pricey, but if you're a total gym rat like me, you'll find it worth it. There are always fresh towels, great-smelling lotions and shampoos in the locker rooms, freshly-cut lemons (the Gainey location only), clean equipment, and top-notch fitness instructors for their varied workout classes. I've been working out my entire life, and I've got to say, DMB's three Village locations (D.C. Ranch, Gainey, and Camelback) all rock and have slightly different vibes going on at each. \\n\\nAs for Gainey, it doesn't have all the space and lacks the family-oriented pool available at D.C. Ranch Village, and the tennis courts and hip bar at the Camelback Village, but if you're looking to get in a good workout or yoga class, it definitely fits the bill. Yoga is my daily addiction, and you can't go wrong with the yogis teaching there. I also like that the cardio equipment faces the basketball court, so you can catch some b-ball action while working up a sweat. Plus, if you keep your eyes open you might run into Charles Barkley, Steve Nash, or even Josh Halloway from \\\"Lost.\\\"\\n\\nIs this a gym for everyone, probably not. You will see a lot of slick, artificially-enhanced women and older guys trying to pick them up (it can be a bit of a meat market, similar to a lot of gyms), but if you like the combination of amenities, which include a lot of special events, trips, and fitness classes, along with regular gym stuff, you'll enjoy Gainey Village.\n"

A few weeks ago told a different story. I had a craving for curry on a Monday night but Saffron is closed on Monday. I did not know this until after I tried three doors before seeing their hours posted on the first door revisited. I was frustrated. Today, though, is Wednesday and Saffron is open.  I parked at about 5:45 in an open and empty lot. As I approached, a man opened the door and warmly welcomed me in. Good impression number one. I was seated immediately as the restaurant was mostly empty much to my surprise. When I was seated I noticed the strong aroma of the many exotic spices I would be enjoying shortly. I also noticed the Indian music lending itself to a comforting and authentic dining experience. Good impression number two. Within less than a minute of being seated I was brought a glass of water, a food menu, a wine menu, a basket of crispy flat bread stuff (apologies for not knowing the true name), and two sauces. A mint sauce and a tamarind sauce. The latter of the two sauces was my favorite. I took a few minutes to familiarize myself with the menu. I settled upon Palak Chicken and a side of Garlic Naan.  The naan came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. It was hot, crisp, and chewy with plenty of minced garlic on top. A few minutes later my Palak Chicken came out in a hot bowl and accompanied with    long grain rice in a separate bowl. The Palak was a brilliant green from the spinach. It was topped with cream and a sprig of cilantro. A beautiful presentation to be sure. I had trouble finding the chicken until I spooned it on to my plate. It was there hiding out amongst the spinach base. It was not the most tender chicken I have had at an Indian restaurant but chicken does not need to be fork tender to be good. It still fell apart in my mouth. Good impression number three. I ate all of my rice but took my Palak Chicken and Garlic Naan home to have for lunch the next day. My check came as I was bagging up my leftovers. It had a smiley face drawn on it. Talk about service with a smile.  Good impression number four. This was very much a comfortable and relaxing dining experience. From the soft spoken and friendly waiter to the delicious food cooked to my spice request of 3 (out of 10), my night at Saffron was just what the doctor ordered. I will be back but probably not all too soon. It is a little  high priced as Indian cuisine tends to be. But when the hunger strikes, an occasional splurge is in well within reason.\n"

It didn't have a crunchy texture to it. They grated some lemon on it probably to mask the unfreshness of the fish. The poki salad had a good flavor but the tuna was not very good.

We had informed them ahead of time that the 5th person in our party would be late and they said no problem.  The 4 of us were sat at our table, the place is tiny and we were right by the door.  I didn't have a problem with that, we love smaller places and the offerings that most of them have.  The 5th person was bringing the wine and we told then we would like to wait a little bit and we would look over the menu in the meantime.  Well, after we got our water upon seating, we never saw the waitress again!  She entered the room 5 or 6 times and never even made eye contact with us.  I had learned that the 5th person was going to be a little later than we thought, so we wanted to go ahead and get our order for our starters in.  Every time the waitress walked in the room she completely ignored us.  I understand we had said we were going to wait a bit, but at least come by and ask us if we're ok!  Well, by the time we flagged her down and placed our order, another 40 min went by before the starters even came out.  Then an absurd amount of time between the starters and the entrees... and again before dessert.  I know that smaller places tend to take longer and that's fine, but this was rediculous! \\n\\nThere was also a dessert that we wanted to order and when we went to place our order she said \\\"oh, that takes and extra 30 mintues to make\\\"  Well, it had been so long by then, forget that!

Seems reasonable.\\n\\nThat being said, the food was amazingly delicious (once I sent the duck back to actually be cooked to medium rare rather than served almost raw).  The steak was absolutely delicious as was the lamb.  Food was 5 star, service - not so much.

While I was there, my teenage son wanted to look around.  I found an XBox360 for sale for $70 and a jacket for $10 that I decided to purchase.  I was not familiar with their policies because I have not shopped there before but have rather just donated.  So I asked the cashier about the XBOX and if it worked or not.  She said she didn't know so I asked if I bought it and it didn't work if I could return it.  She said that was no problem and I said, okay, well, I guess I have nothing to lose as long as I can bring it back if it doesn't work and return it for my money back --- I mean,come on, its an XBOX for $70, I figured it didn't work but thought, \\\"what the heck, If I can bring it back, why not?\\\".  The cashier, Jamie made me feel like it was safe to try.  I took it home and found that it did not work.  I took it back within one hour of purchasing it.  I was told by Ruth that they could only give me store credit.  I told her that Jamie had told me that I could get my money back if it didn't work.  Ruth told me that I should have been aware of their policy because it is posted in the store on a poster hanging above the entrance and on my receipt.  However, I would not have seen this unless I looked up or had already purchased it in order to have the receipt.  At that time, Jamie walked past me and I asked her why she had told me I could return it for my money back.  She said that she thought I could.  So I asked Ruth why, if an employee didn't know the policy, that I was expected to know it?  I told Ruth that I would like to speak to a manager.  She said that there wasn't one available and she would have them call me.  I asked when that would be and she didn't know.  I said, well should I just leave the purchases there and then decline the charges with my credit card.  She said what ever I did was up to me and was very rude.  I said that since she wasn't giving me any options I would just leave everything with her (including the jacket because I was going to try to get my money back from the credit card company).  So I left everything with her because I told her I would be contacting my card company to dispute the charge.  So I took a video of all the merchandise and Ruth taking it and making a note of it on the receipt (which she kept).  \\n\\nOne week later, Ruth called me to tell me she couldn't get her district manager to deal with the issue, nor to even call me.  She told me she could not give me his name or his phone number.  And that I would just need to deal with my credit card company with my issues.  \\n\\nMy credit card company denied the dispute because I had nothing in writing - my video was not suitable proof.  \\n\\nBefore writing this review I called and spoke with Ruth one last time to ask if I could please speak with the district manager because I planned to file a complaint with the BBB (WHICH BUYER BEWARE, THEY ARE NOT MEMBERS) if it could not be resolved.  She said he was on vacation.  And although she was unwilling to give her district manager's name or phone number.  She did tell me that she was given another district manager as their contact person while her manager is on vacation, whom I also wasn't able to reach (surprise, surprise) . \\n\\nHere are the key issues that I feel warrant this review and my claim to the BBB.  \\n#1) The fact is that I have spent $80 in a store and have no product(s) or services to show for it.   However, I do have a video showing me leaving everything with Ruth and vocalized everything happening in the video\\n#2)  The employee, Jamie TOLD me that I could return the XBOX if it didn't work for my money back and they should honor what they said.  Especially since I have been a great donator to this location.  It is very close to my house and I bring all of my children's outgrown clothes and toys as donations.  The irony of it all is that I actually donated more that $80 worth of items on the day that this horrendous customer service experience occurred.\\n#3)  The policy to only give back store credit, while posted in an area of the store - was not well known, because even their own employee was not aware of it.  Also, having it printed on the receipt is illogical because you don't get a receipt until the transaction is already done.  I don't think that my first trip purchasing something in the store should make me more aware of this policy than a store employee knows.\n"

Seventeen enlightening years later, I have rediscovered Tuesday Morning, and all of its knick-knacky goodness. \\n\\nThe name is a bit misleading, because they are open from 10a to 7p Mon- Sat, and Sundays from noon to 6p. They close relatively early to restock every evening, because apparently they get new shipments in every day. Whether or not those shipments include something you want to claim is another story, as this is another one of those hit and miss type stores that requires quite a bit of patience. \\n\\nThe stores have never claimed to be the cleanest or most organized. The aisles are narrow. And by \\\"narrow\\\", I mean \\\"seriously, if you bring your shopping cart down the aisle I am in, you better put that thing in reverse because I'm not moving, and there's not room for all of us\\\".\\n\\nTheir website describes their product selection as: bed & bath, closet & storage, cookware& house wares, crystal, glass & tabletop, decorative home accents, for your pets, gourmet foods, lawn & garden accents, seasonal and toys. Although at some stores, I have honest-to-God seen clothing, including bathrobes and bras. And no, I have never purchased those from there, thankyouverymuch!\\n\\nAround the holidays, you can score some great little nuggets for parties, and even gifts (the kind that won't be regifted). I also like their patio section, even though I'm currently living in a one-bedroom condo with a \\\"patio\\\" the size of a shoebox. A girl can dream...and plan for my next big place. They also have a small selection of kitchen-type furniture at really reasonable prices. \\n\\nI've found party favors for an office party, candles and picture frames, and a really cute wine rack. \\n\\nOverall, if you're planning on making like my mom and browsing through Tuesday Morning, don't wear your Sunday best, because you might get a little dusty, but it will be so worth if you walk out with that perfect entryway table for a steal. And a bra or two.\n"

Opened by a former employee of Lotus of Siam, this place was on his immediate \\\"need to go\\\" list. So we went on opening day and I believe we were one of their first customers in the restaurant.  (FYI - John Curtas just edged in before us.).\\n\\nNow let me get this straight - I'm a little leery when someone tells me it's a \\\"tapas\\\" place. Because my brain translates this to - \\\"we're going to give you 50% less food  but only reduce the price by 20% so you can 'share' and try more things.\\\" It's a FOS total cash grab marketing scheme of which Chada Thai is no exception. We ordered approximately 10 items for 3 people (including two $1 bowls of  rice which they charged extra for) which ended up being about $82.16 pre-tip and left the restaurant hungry. Yeah - we left f&(king hungry and s&*ting gold f&*king bricks afterwards.\\n\\nWe ordered two vegetable dishes - a grilled eggplant dish and a stir-fried mushroom dish. The grilled eggplant ($8) consisted on half of an eggplant marinated in kind of a green papaya salad type dressing. The flavor combination was nice however the grilled eggplant was a little bit tough texturally. The stir-fried mushrooms ($8) consistent of 2-3 different mushrooms with a sliver of lotus root and 1 brussel sprout mixed in. You heard me -1 brussel sprout. There was too little wok hai to the dish and hence the dish was swimming in too much liquid. The flavor was alright but nothing special.\\n\\nThe braised pork belly ($8) had a nice melt in your mouth texture and good flavor. However there were only 5 small slices of meat to go around.\\n\\nThe kai tod (garlic fried chicken) was good ($10) and one of the surprisingly more reasonably priced items on the menu. They actually gave you a large portion of the cornish game hen. The meat itself was tender while the outside was crispy and well seasoned.\\n\\nPad see ew ($6) was one of their better dishes of the night - good flavor with some good crisping of the rice noodles. Their pad thai ($7) though was one of the worst dishes. It was a little unusual for the rice noodle dish to be completely encased in a omelet but we went with it. The omelet was a little bit tough from the overcooked egg while the noodles were completely bland. Not recommended.\\n\\nWe also ordered the steamed sea bass with the plum sauce ($18) which I found to be a little too sweet for my tastes. I would not order this again.\\n\\nMassaman curry ($9) had a nice flavor however was devoid of any real amount of vegetables or meat in the stew. Literally 2 chicken drumsticks, half of a raw small potato and perhaps half an onion.\\n\\nOh and about that raw potato -- so we informed the manager/owner? that the potato in the dish was raw. His response - \\\"but the chicken is cooked, right?\\\". \\\"Yes.\\\" And that was it. He did not offer to correct the problem or even acknowledged that it was an issue at all as long as the chicken was cooked.  He didn't even offer an apology for incorrectly cooked food. That is poor customer service and speaks to the inexperience of the staff that work there.\\n\\nAlthough I appreciate that we went on opening night, I have to say for really hit or miss quality Thai food (I would perhaps get maybe 3 out of the 8 items we ordered again) at over the top pricing for the small portions I would probably not return. However with the added poor service response, I would recommend avoiding this place like the f&*king bubonic plague. 2 starred review.\\n\\nAt the time we went, they didn't have a liquor license but they allowed BYOB without charging corkage fees. Woop de doo.\n"

It said Pasole.  Good thing I am not a vegetarian anymore... I would have been furious.  I notified Girl 2.  She apologized and said I wouldn't have to pay for the pasole... and would get me some chili. How very kind.  Girl 1 came back inquiring.  I told her I thought I ordered chili. \\\"Oh you wanted the BLACK BEAN chili.\\\"  She left.  Girl 2 came back and said, \\\"sorry the pasole is green chili pasole and so they are often confused.\\\"  I asked her to take this plate away. \\n\\nNote to yelp: If you are vegetarian, and want to order the veggie chile make sure you say black bean very clearly this way you don't accidentally take a bite of their chicken pasole.  \\n\\nMy chili came out... it was cold. There was no slice of corn bread or crackers.  Just plain chili, by then my bf was done eating and I wasn't hungry anymore... I got it to go.  They brought me a to coffee cup... I threw my chili in there... we paid for it and went on about our day.\\n\\nPS.  I know I am a bit of a foodie and have given a few other restaurants downtown low reviews.
