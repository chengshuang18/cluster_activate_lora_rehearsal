We went to the Lo Lo's on Central Ave. AlI can say is that Lo Lo's have been removed from my list!\n"

I'm a fan of their salads and their toasts (particularly the lavender and honey, although a little more lavender would be divine), and they always seem to have a great rotating cheese selection. The chocolate & fruit plate is a simple, terrific dessert. My husband assures me that the charcuterie meats and the burger are both very good too, although not, perhaps, the very best burger in Madison.\\n\\nI think I'd go with a 3 1/2 star rating if I had the option, but I'm going to round down for the moment and hopefully update later on. Places for improvement: (1) We have one of the best farmer's markets around, so there are a zillion veggies available. More veggie (or fish, even?) options, please! (2) I've heard it's quiet at lunchtime (although I've only ever been for dinner), but if you're there for a late dinner, it turns clubby. I haven't ever seen much dancing, but the dance music gets turned up loudly enough to make conversation difficult. (3) Merchant does seem to get busy for dinner, and their waitstaff is well-informed but spread a little too thin.\\n\\nUPDATE 25 July 2011: Haven't been back yet, so no official update, but the owner messaged me to let me know that they had hired additional summer staff and changed the DJ hours. The DJ will now begin spinning at 10.30 on weekends, which seems like a great change to me, as I do enjoy a late dinner particularly in the summer! So, now y'all can either go for the dancing or plan around it more effectively... thanks, Josh. :)\n"

I cannot imagine how many hundreds of thousands of dollars were used on redoing this place. Kudos on that aspect.  The checkin process was great, everybody was super nice. Anyone I ever saw working the front desk was someone who looked like they just graduated high school. \\n\\nMy room (262) was very clean, bed was made exquisitely, countertops wiped clean, mirrors clean, no stray hairs in the tub (my pet peeve) and clean toilet.

YIKES! This guy was about 3/4 the size of my pinky nail- and that is a decent size for a bedbug. I took pictures and videos.  There were bites on my neck and arms. (I didnt see the dozens of bites on my legs until later).. I then called Priceline's help desk because I know when going through there all sales are final: Non refundable and Non transferrable. Sure enough, they couldnt do anything for me, but they did give me credit on the next purchase I made through them. Fair enough. \\n\\n\\nI go to the front desk and the young man who had been there all night since 11 was nice and helpful, he called his manager at home since it wasn't letting him switch rooms. Since it was pre-paid through a third party site, refund was not an option (Note: I would have LOVED to left this place and never returned, but since I couldnt get my money back on the 2nd night I had coming and didn't have the money for a room at a different hotel- it was either take a different room or sleep in my car)\\n\\nI had to leave and go to the meetings, and at around 4pm, I was given a call saying that I had my new room.

I couldnt yell at the front desk help (again, kids that looked about 20)- it wasn't their fault directly that I was bitten. The young lady said somebody has sprayed the room I had stayed in and housekeeping did a thorough job cleaning it. (It takes more than that to get rid of them, but motel staff will have to deal with that )\\n\\nThe second night in the new room was fine. The room appeared just as clean as the last one. I had no new bites from the second night, I made sure to look very carefully before going to bed. Perhaps the bedbugs came from a previous guest and they were confined to that room, I will never know, I don't care. I just know I was bitten many, many times. \\n\\n Checkout procedure was very quick and very polite, no word from a manager still. \\n\\nI will never go back, and will never recommend it.
