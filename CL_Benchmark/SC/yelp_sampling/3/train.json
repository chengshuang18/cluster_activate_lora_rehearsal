I already have a career that I love so the classes for me was more of personal growth and professional development and not necessarily looking to start from scratch in a new career. \\n\\nI work with Veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in a clinical and case management setting. When I saw the workshop on how to teach yoga for veterans and others with PTSD I felt it was a good fit. I was always interested in teaching yoga to my current clientele and felt that this course would be the perfect fit for me.  I was extremely disappointed. I completed the course feeling upset, hurt and angry. What was being taught in class went blatantly against 'best practices' that had been outlined by the nation's leading trauma experts (Dr. Bessel van der kolk, Judith Herman, Peter Levine) and in certain cases what was taught could cause a lot of harm to a population that is already hurting. \\n\\nBeing a class about trauma the instructor didn't even touch on the most common reason for trauma for Veterans or even for the general population. When I brought it up he was like \\\"what is that?\\\" During break out group sessions my classmates were asking me loads of questions often saying that I sound more like i \\\"knew what I was talking about\\\" than the instructor.  Sad.\\n\\nI ended up completing an EXCELLENT program in Massachusetts. I showed several of my classmates the course material from SWIHA and they were in disbelief of what was being taught as compared to what we were learning at the school in Massachusetts. \\n\\nIt was just one class and I can't base an entire school off one teacher so I started looking into the Aromatherapy certification. This is a certification that I want for no other reason other than personal growth. What can I say? I LOVE learning. I was about to sign up for it when instead I decided to check out its credentials. Aromatherapy is a self regulated field represented by two organizations in the United States, the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists (AIA). Neither of those organizations listed SWIHA as an approved school. Well there goes that plan to take aromatherapy classes at SWIHA. Thank goodness I didn't pay for it yet!\\n\\nI spoken to many students at the school and the information given to them by the school of what the program is truly about is not exactly the case. I have spoken to a handful that were told that the 800-hours Teaching Training Program is to directly lead you to becoming a yoga therapist. SWIHA website even states \\\"800 Hour Yoga Teacher Training / Yoga Therapist\\\"  Sadly, that is NOT the case. SWIHA is not approved by the International Associations of Yoga Therapy (IAYT).\\n\\nI have been warned by many in the community about this school---several of my yoga teachers in the community told me not to attend because of its reputation. I should have believed them from the start.\\n\\nI removed SWIHA's website from my favorites. I won't take their catalog next time I am shopping at Whole Foods. I give up on them. \\n\\nSave your time and money. Don't go here.\n"

This time my order was packaged correctly but I noticed the panang curry was more oily than usual and contained very little sauce. I also saw that there was baby corn, various peppers, onions, and green beans. Penny described inaccurately what vegetables were in the dish. What if I was allergic? People need to be careful these days and not say things unless they are 100% sure. Both the panang curry and Thai spaghetti were a solid three stars, but after my shocking take out order and misdescribed dishes the most I can give this restaurant is two stars.\n"

This place..... meh.\\n\\nWe walk in, and the first thing I notice to be different is its not a sit down, order, and food is brought to you kind of place. Its a order at the register, wait for food to come out kind of place. Which I was not expecting and frankly it confused me. The prices were extremely high for this kind of establishment. We ordered a few different items. The portabello and artichoke bruschetta, $4.50. Was it worth the money? No way. It was one thick slice of bread spread with a thin layer of goat cheese, topped with a minuscule amount of peppers, artichokes, and hardly any mushrooms. It did taste good, but definitely not a good value for the money. We also ordered the portabello and artichoke pizza $9.75, as well as the mushroom and arugula pizza, $9.75. I don't know where this place gets off charging the amount of money they do for how little food they give you. Their pizzas are a thin crust, with a thin layer of sauce, and a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Do people actually come here on a regular basis and pay this much for such a thin pizza? If they do something must be wrong with them. Either that or they are so dazzled by the Fox name that they don't care where they throw their cash. Now don't get me wrong. The pizzas all tasted really good, but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here, which is the only reason for the two star review. I don't just review taste, I also review value. And the value here for what you get is none. \\n\\nAlso, places like this that don't pay their employees at least minimum wage really bother me. At the register you pay and they have a tip line. I don't usually tip at these kinds of places where all the service I get is food being brought out to me or if I do I don't tip the usual amount, but I was so flustered by this I had no idea what to do. I even asked the girl do people usually tip, and she told me they were tip based pay employees. Seriously? They don't do anything worth the tip. At that point I felt obligated to tip so I did. And I still feel like I shouldn't have. All in all I spent $34 dollars on about $5 worth of ingredients. I wont be back.\n"

I can't do half stars so this place will get my 4...  \\n\\nI was visiting my father-in-law over the weekend for his birthday.  We stopped by Don Jose's before starting our day.  I was recommended the chorizo and the chile relleno burritos.  The chile relleno sounded really good, and was going to go with that until I saw the lengua burritos.  I LOVE lengua.  Could not pass up the opportunity so I went with the lengua burrito (which defaultly *is this a word?*) comes with onions and cilantro.\\n\\nI ordered the lengua burrito with sour cream and guacmole in it.  It was SOOOO DELICIOUS.  I'm salivating right now thinking about how good this burrito was.  The burrito was a pretty nice size.  Bigger than a 1/2 lb burrito from Taco Bell, but smaller than ones at Chipotle.  The flavor.  The texture.  The combination....  It was heavenly, and filling.  The lengua was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nThe service here at Don Jose's was very attentive.  I believe the owners is the man himself and his wife.  They have about 4 sauce selections to choose from.  There was a dark red, a regular tomato/pico de gallo salsa, green salsa, and I forgot what else.  I loved all of them but I'm a huge fan of the green.  The burrito could go without the sauce, but I'm a well known sauce bandit so it was pretty saucey.\\n\\nWith the order, we ordered a California Burrito, Chorizo Burrito, 2 Ham and Egg Breakfast Burrito, and a Sausage and Egg Breakfast Burrito.  I took a bite out of the Chorizo Burrito, it was pretty good.  Greasy like how a chorizo really is, but the burrito packs a (heavy) flavor punch.\\n\\nWhen I come back to Arizona to visit again, I will definitely have to make a stop to Don Jose's.  Not sure if I will go with a new burrito though.... Lengua has been on my mind since then.\n"

Even during the daytime hours, I prefer Ritter's to Pamela's. Ritter's is spacious - no matter what time I show up, I've never had to wait. It's not anything to marvel at, but it's diner food, and you're getting exactly what you think. \\n\\nTheir menu is typical diner food, but more expansive than most - I was a little surprised to see seafood options. Ultimately, I always come back to the corned beef hash. Exactly like canned corned beef hash in every other diner, but that's exactly what I'm looking for. I also occasionally order the wings because Ritter's makes them the way I prefer - freshly fried, naked, with your choice of dipping sauce on the side. I've occasionally tried to branch out but find other dishes lacking. The meatloaf was dry, lacking in flavor, but still a very heavy dish; the burger was even dryer and was served deconstructed - in a bad way. However, friends have had the differing variants of the pancakes and enjoyed them. \\n\\nOverall, the cheap prices (yet cash only!), 24 hour convenience, and rectifying my late night munchies get Ritter's a thumbs-up in my book.\n"

Chef Marvin's reply was an unexpected gesture that has made me willing to try the restaurant again in hopes service has improved.\\n \\nOk so last night we returned to Echo & Rig in hopes of a better experience and let me say they DIDN'T disappoint! Let start by saying the fact that the two hostesses are always above and beyond they've remembered us by name which is a nice touch and are always smiling and always helpful to our needs ( we have 3 little ones ) Then we so lucky to sit in Ricky's section ( 2nd time we've been served by him ) Ricky remember us from our last visit and welcomed us back. Knowing the kids can be uneasy and impatient at times he asked if we'd like to get the children started and took our appetizer and cocktails order as well. Like I've stated in my previous post we've been here many times so we know the menu so ordered our main course shortly after as he poured us water. Food as always was amazing and I can't say enough about the services as it was the best experience yet! Echo and Rig has restored our faith in the service and we'll keep spreading word-of-mouth to all our friends and family about this wonderful overall experience.\n"
