They serve small plate style dishes here, everything is a la carte, it best to order to share. Order a few items at a time and they will filter out of the kitchen as they are finished. They will bring it all at once if you request it but frankly that's not the experience you should be after here. The menu is on the wall and changes frequently from the looks of it.\\n\\nStaff was very attentive and helpful as our French is non existent. It was explained that they really try to source from Quebec first, Canada second, and lastly elsewhere. Our evening started off with drinks I had a local beer and my wife a local cidre.  Our waiter explained the specials and the feast commenced. We started off with the stuffed oyster, Lebanese lamb tartare, and Asian style greens. The oyster arrived first and what an oyster, the size of my hand stuffed with onions, herbs, cheese, and more. Very rich and filling as we finished that tartare and greens arrived. The tartare was prepared excellently with middle eastern spice and a tzatziki style sauce. The greens were amazing garlic, chilies, soy sauce, and dry-salted cured pork. Being pleased with everything so far we pressed on wanting to savor every bite our last night out in Montreal. Me moved on to the fried rabbit and clam special. The rabbit was tender and tasty broken down into quarters and lightly fried. The clams came with an amazing broth garlic, chilis, and herbs. Skipping dessert was not an option having seen them go by to other diners as we ate. A seasonal rhubarb parfait was the perfect way to end my meal, my wife couldn't resist the pot de creme, a rich smooth chocolate custard. C'est fini!\n"

We had random OJ's, Cranberry drinks etc to mix with it. The bouncers in the VIP kept a VERY close eye on our group making sure we did NOT sit even an inch over our 'designated' seating space. lol. It was a fun night, nice club. Halfway through the night someone (not in our party) had puked down one of the main walkways leading down to the dance floor and they could have cleaned it up A LOT faster. Not only did it smell foul, we had to basically hop around it and walk around the small rag looking towels they threw over it....YUCK.

Not the case, we waited about 10 minutes and we were told there was a option to dine indoors or 'outdoors' - at this point I said dining outdoors.  We were then told that the menus are different depending on where you sit and I still mentioned that outdoors was fine for the group.  We were seated and guess what - there was the 'other menu' that was only for the indoors guest.  I already started realizing their staff have NO idea what's going on and there isn't consistent communication between the owner and staff as to what should be communicated to guests.  But our night gets better...\\n\\nWe were seated and our waiter (whom we saw once and only once) asked to take our orders.  We were relatively quick in giving our orders to the waiter and he said he would put the order in.  We were given our bread and we munched on it as I checked the clock.  Dinner reservations were at 6pm (I always expect incompetence) and our show was at 9:30pm.  Well, this \\\"Spago\\\" place had us waiting for our meals for over 1 HOUR.  Meanwhile our unattentive, incompetent waiter AND owner did not even come by our table to explain to us what the issue was (if there was any issue).  Anybody in the restaurant business, or any business would say to keep an open line of communication with your customers so it APPEARS that you know what in the actual f*** is going on in the kitchen.  I understand being understaffed, or a kitchen rush, or whatever it may be but not a word from these two.  Nobody came by except the man who was very attentive to refilling our waters.  \\n\\nNow, once we received our food people were relatively happy, but one person was disgusted as the salmon was overcooked.  At that rate, we should've asked them to use the kitchen and cooked the meal ourselves. Seriously,  if anyone has to wait that long the food better be amazing and when everyone isn't happy it is a tremendous fail.  We heard all of the BS about about the food being handmade but explain to me how there was another table that came in WAY after us and had their food WAY before us.  And they weren't appetizers.  The manager of this restaurant didn't care but we wanted a business card so we can follow up with the general manager since they are a separate establishment - guess what? he didn't have any.  What manager doesn't have business cards on them? \\n\\nI wouldn't recommend you going here and I wouldn't recommend my enemy going here either. This is just not worth your time OR MONEY...there are better restaurants out there for competitive prices.  Nothing to see at this establishment but they are clearly enjoying the benefit of being inside the Forum Shops.  Don't say you weren't warned...\n"

I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Lo's, I was going to go for it. \\n\\nThe food came pretty quickly. The first thing that struck me were the two enormous globs of butter (1 in my grits and 1 on my waffles). In all my life, I have never knowingly eaten this much butter in a single sitting. That being said, it was divine. Everything was delicious and, while I am not a big \\\"fried chicken\\\" guy, I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly. Other members of our group sampled the fried okra and the red beans & rice. I heard nothing but happy sounds as our table of 7 made approximately 15,000 calories disappear. This was followed by groans and calls for afternoon naps as we all piled into our cars to go home. \\n\\nLo Lo's is one of those experiences that should not be missed. But, make sure to clear your afternoon and, just to be safe, you may want to consult a health professional.\n"

I call back and get a girl again. I explain who talked to me last and she goes \\\"that little f*cker I know who that was\\\". I'm again asked if I want them to bring our drinks (YES) and she puts the delivery man on. He explains that no one told him to make his way back down and that he will and it will be THIRTY MINUTES. I tell him we'll just come down cause that's too long to wait. He then tells me it'll be more like 10 and asks if I'm sure I want him to come by with just drinks (..YES). \\n\\n15 minutes later (midnight on the dot) I get my drinks and pita (1 pita..to share between 2 people) and he looked totally uninterested in apologizing for the 2 HOURS of bull. \\n\\nThe food was good (who knows if they spit in anything because with the way they were acting its quite possible) but that part of the experience was totally trumped by the horrid customer service.\n"

I wish I would have know about Tropicana Cinemas years ago because everyone enjoys going to the movies, but is there really anything \\\"that\\\" special about a particular theater? NO not really. Most people enjoy deals and discounts. This is a second showing theater which plays all the movies that were just in the bigger first showing theaters. If you can wait a couple weeks to see a movie and go here you can literally see 5 different movies for the price you would have paid to see one!!! Now that's a great deal to me. Located on pecos and tropicana its not the greatest neighborhood around but also not the worst and now I've been there many times and can't complain about any experience. There's never a long line to wait in, they are very quick with ticket sales, and there's security at the door checking bags for safety. The convenience stand has comparable prices to any other theater, the bathrooms are clean ( atleast when I've went) and the theater seating are just as good as any other theater. Tickets are onlu 2 $ a piece! IMAX for 3 $ and on Tuesday they have tickets for 1 $ !!! If you go every tuesday in a month with your partner or friend you will spend 8 $ only and see 4 different movies. Just saying a good deal is a good deal.

Getting to the restaurant is a relative maze and fortunately having been their before I helped guide us thru the treacherous mazeways that is the Venetian hotel.  Taking a dedicated elevator up to the 10th floor, you walk down an ornate and sumptuous hallway leading to the restaurant entrance, hinting you are in for some kind of occasion.\\n\\nWe sat down and starting attacking the menu with a series of orders that go something like this:\\n\\nMarinated octopus salad with grilled eggplant, cucumbers, parsley & mint vinegrette - This was a pleasant surprise as the octupus tentacles were sliced, cooked to near perfection meaning  they were tender to the bite, not rubbery in the least and unless you see the suckers you would have no idea you were eating mollusk meat.\\n\\nEscargots in puff pastry - I'll be honest, while I always order escargot, its not because I love or even like snails that much, its because of the rich, buttery, garlic sauce that I soak up with the accompanying puff pastry and any bread that maybe leftover on the table.  Ah what a delicious heart attack in a mini baking tin\\n\\nCod brandade beignets with tomato confit & fried sage - I had no idea what to expect but these weren't like the beignets I've tried before, almost like a light, crispy potato or taro fritter and also really good.  Something reminiscient of Indian pakooras or samosas but much more delicate.\\n\\nKurobuta pork loin with summer stone fruit - Juicy and tender pork loin, I love pig, this is prepared very simple without and excess of sauce and garnish.  \\n\\nWhite sausage with potato pur\\u00e9e & French prunes - I'm a fan of boundin noir, french black blood sausage so I decided to give its mirror counterpart a try.  Again, fantastic and with a totally different flavour to black sausage it tasted quite meaty like any good breakfast sausage and something I could see myself enjoying with eggs and a french toast.\\n\\nSteak frites - Now I've been to NYC Brasserie Les Halles which prides itself on its steak frites, but to be honest theirs seems like an overcooked, flat piece of meat compared to what Bouchon serves up, good lord, you get a surprisingly thick and juicy piece of steak for surprisingly not a bad price.  Sadly the pommes frites are cooked in peanut oil and not duckfat like the NYC counterparts are.  Gotta love the lardons canard...\\n\\nI feel like any Vegas trip should be crowned by one destination meal if budget allows and Bouchon certainly did the trick on this trip.

The bearded dragons also looked healthier and had better coloration.\\nOne last note; this store is in El Mirage, not Surprise, like one of their ads said and you cannot get to the store directly from Grand Ave. You have to pull off before you get to the store and drive around to it.\\n\\n*Edit\\nPratt's in Surprise has taken to keeping different species of animals in the same cage with each other. The last time I was in the store they had captive bred Sulcatas and Bearded Dragons in with wild caught Green Iguanas. Not only is this dangerous to the lizards, because they could injure each other, but the Iguanas could have parasites that could be transferred to the other CB lizards.

I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\\n\\nDelmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\\n\\nThe Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\\n\\nLuckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\\n\\nThe online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.\n"
