The wedge, also, a little boring, lacking bacon and blue cheese crumbles.\\n\\nOthers ordered the chicken piccata and I was a little shocked at the small portions.  For $19.95, they received tiny, tiny medallions of chicken.  It was definitely not worth the Strip prices despite the great taste.\\n\\nOverall, good food but way too expensive for the portion size and atmosphere.

I just moved to Las Vegas from NY 2 months ago and was looking for a dentist.  This one is right near my house and it got good reviews on here, so I decided to give them a try.  \\n\\nThe first question the Dr. asked me when he looked in my mouth is if I ever considered braces.

Dr. Tran's recommendation was $2400 worth of replacement fillings for all of my teeth.  This seemed bizarre as I know that amalgam fillings are typically used to bigger cavities and tend to hold up better than their \\\"tooth colored\\\" counterparts.  \\n\\nI did, however, feel as though I got a good cleaning and it was done by the dentist, which you don't see very often anymore.  \\n\\nAnyway, today I called my dentist back in NY who told me that replacing all my fillings was unnecessary and seeing as how I was just there less than 6 months ago, there is no way my teeth could have gotten THAT bad.  \\n\\nI went to a new dentist today and he was right on with my old dentist in stating that there were nothing wrong with my fillings, and, in fact, if he were to remove them and put in porcelain or resin-composite, my teeth would be MORE sensitive than they are and I would probably end up with nerve damage seeing as how my cavities were all pretty deep.\\n\\nSo, save your time and money and go see Dr. Ruper @ Boston Dental on W.

We were not picky and we were attracted to the different promos going on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It has three floors, the basement which is considered a club (in all honesty, they shouldn't), the second floor is a nice bar with a live band (usually) and the third floor is Karinas (always empty but a good spot to rent for private events). Needless to say that the spot I usually go to is on the second floor: they don't have a cover on weekends and they have a much better terrace than the basement. The band I usually get when I go is pretty good and the feeling of the place is very casual. It has the same feeling as a McGibbons or an Irish Pub. Winston Churchil gets a 3 stars for the atmosphere. \\n\\nDrinks & Food\\n\\nI am not a big fan of the drinks served at Winston Churchill. Besides their Sangria, every drink that is not a beer was poorly done. The only positive point that Winston Churchill has over other bars is that it is cheaper. On Tuesdays they have a special which is $2.50 for the drink and $4 the beer, which in my opinion, is a great deal. The food aspect of this place is as you would expect bar food to be (typical nachos and fries) however what is interesting with this place is that the food is not the same from one floor to another (probably because the vibe of the floors are different: the basement being a ''club'' and the second floor being a bar with a pub feel to it). This Montreal bar gets a 2 stars for its drinks.\\n\\nService\\n\\nThe service on the terrace is usually really bad, with the exception of one or two good waitresses. I don't think I have ever got so much attitude coming from a waitress before. However, if you decide to stay inside on the basement level, I would go ask for a bartender called Valerie. She is very nice and talkative and will make sure you have a good night. The service of this Montreal bar gets 2 stars.  \\n\\nLocation\\n\\nThe location of Winston Churchill is particularly good during the summer considering it is located on Crescent street (it's awesome during the Grand Prix weekend) and awesome for when you go to school downtown. Its proximity to metro Guy Concordia makes it really easy to access as well. For all these reasons, Winston Churchill gets 4 stars for its location.\\n\\nThe total amount of stars I would allocate to Winston Churchill in general would be 3.\n"

They provide equal amount of wings and legs, which are sized bigger than what you find at your typical spots, even those that specialize in wings, like say, Famous Wings.  We tried the Spicy Garlic.  Pretty typical selection, but these wings had fresh (browned) minced garlic actually sprinkled ON TOP of them.

When was the last time you heard someone request to \\\"start\\\" some chips and salsa.  I was eager to discover what he meant by that.  Five minutes later, we were graced be FRESHLY MADE in-house tortilla chips with light (and delicious) seasoning in a smoky and firey house salsa.  It was perfect, and worthy of a class Mexican restaurant.  \\n\\nSpokes, as it turns out, is actually more of a bar than a restaurant despite its flare for the amazing presented on its menu.  They have very cool and unique selection of beer.  I had two pints of Drop Top Ale and my gf had a Moose Drool and finished with the Drop Top as well.  The manager also mentioned that he replaced his Guinness tap with Strong Arm Stout because it tasted much like the grandaddy of all stouts, was more interesting, and well, had an awesome pull tap.  I agreed.\\n\\nSpokes has a full bar with an experienced bartender making them.  Today, they had a specialty drink with Madori, Captain's, Malibu, and pineapple juice for like $3.  He also mentioned several themed nights if you're into that.  Personally, I'm not, but its a superb place to day drink on a Sunday after hiking South Mountain.  This place picks up a lot of that, as well as cyclers, hence its name.\\n\\nThe experience was awesome and its cool to find a local Valley bar that hits all the right notes, including the previously mentioned manager/bartender.  He was probably the friendliest and most helpful I've experienced in the Valley.  He also insisted we sample different beers before we made a decision.

We are beer nerds so it makes for a lovely surprise that a unassuming Bistro would have such an impressive drink menu. The BF wasn't sure of what, and our server (I think possibly the owner) asked what kinds of flavors he likes and gave a few recommendations. I always appreciate a place that knows what they sell since it seems most people don't care about beer the way they do of wine. The BF took his suggestion of a Augustjn Abbey Ale ($7) and I had a Troubadour Obscura ($7) which the guy poured into TULIPS with care to produce a proper head! I had a nerd moment that they had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our drinks as much as we do. He treated it like a sommelier would a fine wine. \\n\\nWhile we waited for food we were served papadam with a tamarind chutney and a cilrantro mint chutney. All really finely made. \\n\\nFor food we really couldn't decide to we went with a Indian Sampler ($30). It doesn't look like a lot of food, but we were both comfortably full.\\n\\nIt includes:\\n\\n*chicken tikka masala- this was a lovely tikka. I've had a lot and this was one of the better ones I've had. Very robust, but balanced. The BF loved this and raves it's the best curry he's had and he had a foodie moment (aww, I think us Yelpers are getting to him...maybe he'll change his mind about doing reviews one day). \\n\\n*lamb vindaloo- the lamb was very tender and the sauce complimented it very well with a bit earthiness, tangyness and a tad spicy. \\n\\n*tandoori chicken- crisp and nicely spiced outside, juicy inside\\n\\n*mixed veggie curry- had a good mix of cauliflower, zucchini, beans, peppers. The curry had a very light and fragrant flavor to it...I can't quite place the spices, but I liked this. \\n\\n*chef choice of lentils- today it was daal. I like daal since it's earthy and comforting. \\n\\n*we got yoghurt, basmati rice, and garlic naan as well. The naan was pretty noms here. \\n\\n*Khir came with it for dessert. It's a rice and milk porridge with raisins, nuts and cardamom according to the menu. When I was eating it, to me it tasted more flowery than just cardamom, like possible orange blossom water was added. It's the kind of light dessert that would be amazing for a hot summer day since it's served cold and has such bright flavors.\\n\\nWe also ordered another dessert that I thought I had and loved at another restaurant and at friends house but haven't come across it in a while. Turns out it was what I was looking for! \\n\\nLal Mohan ($2.99) the description says it's served cold, but it's served piping hot! It's these round pastries that are fried so the outside is crisp and the inside has a creamy kind of dough. They throw it into syrup and it absorbs it so it flavors it throughout.They come 3 to a serving in a shot glass, balls are about gumball sized so you don't get much of it, but it's quality. It's a comforting kind of dessert that would be a good for people who like fried mochi with honey, warm donuts, zeppolis, beignets. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and helpful. I like the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates. Utensils were impeccably polished- no water marks at all.

They serve lots of different types of food, and I have yet to find a weak link. The jambalaya I had yesterday was extremely delicious. It had meat or vegetable in every bite, and it was large enough for me to spread over lunch and dinner. Other hits include the calzones, pizza, burgers, pasta, and sandwiches.\\n\\nThey seem to be everywhere nowadays, but don't miss BJ's assortment of Pizookies. Get the original, or indulge yourself with the triple chocolate.\\n\\nAmbiance: It is a large dining room with a high ceiling, so it's never that loud.

Lunch specials start at $6, and regular prices are very fair.\\n\\nThis location is right next to the Harkins movie theater, and it makes a great place to stop after seeing a flick.\n"

While I was there, my teenage son wanted to look around.  I found an XBox360 for sale for $70 and a jacket for $10 that I decided to purchase.  I was not familiar with their policies because I have not shopped there before but have rather just donated.  So I asked the cashier about the XBOX and if it worked or not.  She said she didn't know so I asked if I bought it and it didn't work if I could return it.  She said that was no problem and I said, okay, well, I guess I have nothing to lose as long as I can bring it back if it doesn't work and return it for my money back --- I mean,come on, its an XBOX for $70, I figured it didn't work but thought, \\\"what the heck, If I can bring it back, why not?\\\".  The cashier, Jamie made me feel like it was safe to try.  I took it home and found that it did not work.  I took it back within one hour of purchasing it.  I was told by Ruth that they could only give me store credit.  I told her that Jamie had told me that I could get my money back if it didn't work.  Ruth told me that I should have been aware of their policy because it is posted in the store on a poster hanging above the entrance and on my receipt.  However, I would not have seen this unless I looked up or had already purchased it in order to have the receipt.  At that time, Jamie walked past me and I asked her why she had told me I could return it for my money back.  She said that she thought I could.  So I asked Ruth why, if an employee didn't know the policy, that I was expected to know it?  I told Ruth that I would like to speak to a manager.  She said that there wasn't one available and she would have them call me.  I asked when that would be and she didn't know.  I said, well should I just leave the purchases there and then decline the charges with my credit card.  She said what ever I did was up to me and was very rude.  I said that since she wasn't giving me any options I would just leave everything with her (including the jacket because I was going to try to get my money back from the credit card company).  So I left everything with her because I told her I would be contacting my card company to dispute the charge.  So I took a video of all the merchandise and Ruth taking it and making a note of it on the receipt (which she kept).  \\n\\nOne week later, Ruth called me to tell me she couldn't get her district manager to deal with the issue, nor to even call me.  She told me she could not give me his name or his phone number.  And that I would just need to deal with my credit card company with my issues.  \\n\\nMy credit card company denied the dispute because I had nothing in writing - my video was not suitable proof.  \\n\\nBefore writing this review I called and spoke with Ruth one last time to ask if I could please speak with the district manager because I planned to file a complaint with the BBB (WHICH BUYER BEWARE, THEY ARE NOT MEMBERS) if it could not be resolved.  She said he was on vacation.  And although she was unwilling to give her district manager's name or phone number.  She did tell me that she was given another district manager as their contact person while her manager is on vacation, whom I also wasn't able to reach (surprise, surprise) . \\n\\nHere are the key issues that I feel warrant this review and my claim to the BBB.  \\n#1) The fact is that I have spent $80 in a store and have no product(s) or services to show for it.   However, I do have a video showing me leaving everything with Ruth and vocalized everything happening in the video\\n#2)  The employee, Jamie TOLD me that I could return the XBOX if it didn't work for my money back and they should honor what they said.  Especially since I have been a great donator to this location.  It is very close to my house and I bring all of my children's outgrown clothes and toys as donations.  The irony of it all is that I actually donated more that $80 worth of items on the day that this horrendous customer service experience occurred.\\n#3)  The policy to only give back store credit, while posted in an area of the store - was not well known, because even their own employee was not aware of it.  Also, having it printed on the receipt is illogical because you don't get a receipt until the transaction is already done.  I don't think that my first trip purchasing something in the store should make me more aware of this policy than a store employee knows.\n"
