Plus, it makes sense since you sell firearms, ammunition, accessories and targets.  \\n3. Expand your horizons/knowledge of outdoor recreational activities.  Include things like climbing gear (think REI).  You could really do some damage if your company merged with REI or at least took some pages out of their book.  \\n4. Offer a loyalty-based \\\"annual dividend\\\"/discount program like the one REI has.  Combined with their legendary customer service and return program, they're my #1 go-to place for outdoor equipment.  You're missing out.\\n5. Some of the gear you offer is for amateur cheapskates.  Offer some higher-end products.  Take a look at the lifejacket/PFD department, for instance.  All that stuff sucks, and is only for someone who is either really cheap or doesn't care about what they're buying.  On that note, the swimming goggle section sucks, too.  I was there to check out some Columbia shirts, then decided to look around for other things.  Since I was looking for some good swimming goggles, I stopped by that section, but quickly left when I realized that it sucks.  Again, you're missing out on sales.\n"

I researched reviews before deciding to purchase tickets and many of them lowered my expectations especially the quality of the food and mentions of using office chairs and there was nothing explain what the couples seating looked like. Looking at the seating chart it was hard to imagine what the seats were like because there were no pictures, which made me suspicious; were hiding something? It was common sense to me that the office type chairs must be located at the counter seating (C) and the couple seating were the (A) & (B) selections and they had to be a different style, which turned out to be somewhat accurate. The seating chart has dotted lines leading you to think these were short sections of counters but that wasn't so, in actuality there is a solid line of counters stretching from one side to the other of the auditorium with the office type chairs lined up behind them. The chart also doesn't reflect how much spacing there is between the rows, so for those reading this there is a 5' walking isle behind the office chairs and the couples seating is directly behind that, then the next length of counter space is directly behind those seats and so on. They could use a lesson from how iPic shows their seating charts, like the spacing and layout where the seats are placed along with pictures. The isle walking space was convenient for the servers and people to use, unlike other theaters (including iPic) that you have to excuse yourself as you squeeze through to get to the end isles. The couple seats are like over-sized office chairs but without the wheels and swivels, the center arm rest will flip up and the back tilts slightly, they were about as comfortable as the soft tilting back chairs as some Harkins and AMC theaters have. The VIP (V) seats were at the ends of the rows which don't get the best sound and screen quality and they appeared to be a little softer but because of the location there is nothing VIP about them. \\nNow the food; well I've had worse at theaters but for the price I would expect better. The $10 all you can eat pizza was OK but nothing special and better than heated up frozen pizzas like most theaters have. I had pepperoni first then Italian sausage; both needed more meat or thicker slices as the meat flavor was over powered by the dough and sauce. My wife chose the overpriced Tenderloin Tip entree with sweet potato fries which were warm and soft with no crunch at all and the meat was hospital food bland but good after she doused it with salt and pepper. But if you think about it all theater foods and snacks are overpriced, as Dan Harkins once said in an interview, \\\"I sell popcorn, candy and soda, the movies are included in the price\\\", meaning if they didn't have concessions less people would go to the movies because the price would be so high to pay for the reel rentals. I liked the plastic serving dishes because they were quite, the noise of clinking plates and utensils at iPic drives me nuts when you're used to a quieter environment in a theater. \\nThe bar was well stocked and the prices were about the same as the surrounding pubs and restaurants, if you order beer and plan of having more than 4-glasses order a large picture, they won't mention it but it's a better deal until they read this and figure it out, then it might change.

Thank Goodness the Cardinals won, because this experience would've ruined my gameday otherwise. \\nWe were seated right away, and a waiter came over to take drink orders, which we got in good time. So far, so good. We were offered chips and salsa. But then the waiter tells us that they are putting all the food orders in at 11am, when the kitchen opens, in staggered order so it doesn't overwhelm the kitchen. Tells us it could be 35-40 minutes. No problem. There was a sign on the wall about a grand reopening just two days earlier....that should've been an indication they haven't ironed out the kinks just yet. Food was coming very slowly out of the kitchen. There were other football fans, Eagles fans, behind us screaming profanity at the TV in earshot of my kids. Best of all, the GM-- a younger looking guy in a hat, was plainly drinking beer from a can BEHIND the bar.  Is that even legal??  Waiter comes out at 11:35 and says it's still going to be another 25 minutes...OK..still good, and I asked to pay ahead so when our food comes we can eat & bolt for the stadium.  12:10 comes and no food-- and we're not alone, I talked to a guy in the bathroom who waited an hour with no food.  So when I ask the waiter says our order hasn't even been started and it'll be another 30  minutes and I ask to have my charge refunded. The waiter does this and offers a free round of beers for the inconvenience.  We asked if they'd just take that round of beers off our bar tab...DENIED! \\nI won't be giving this place another chance, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else either.  But I will offer some advice to the GM....1. don't drink on the job---very unprofessional!    2.  If you have a dining room full of hungry folks drinking and watching football at 10am,  why wait until 11 to open your kitchen??  You're asking for an overwhelmed line every Sunday.

The hostess welcomed us when she pulled up our reservation she wished us a happy anniversary, as did our server when she came to the table. We sat at a cozy 2 top at the far end of the (relatively small) dining room, just beside the end of the bartop. \\n\\nThey offered some complimentary sparkling wine (cava) because it was our anniversary, it was nice to start off with a toast! \\n\\nPosh's concept is all-tasting menu, all the time and you do not know what you'll be getting, it is the Chef's choice. I LOVE TASTING MENUS! Absolutely my favorite thing - I could eat little food forever and be completely happy as I prefer lots of small bites of different interesting things over a gigantic steak/starch/vegetable plate. So, this restaurant is really made for me. In lieu of a menu, you get a sheet where you cross off any proteins you aren't interested in and let the Chef know about likes/dislikes. \\n\\nWe started off with an amuse bouche of a sorbet with basil. It was crisp and refreshing.\\n\\nMy first course was a play on a caprese - tomato sorbet, tomato \\\"pate\\\", basil leaves, a balsamic reduction, and a few shavings of cheese... this dish was okay. The presentation was beautiful and the elements tasted good, but there was way more tomato with just a few scraps of cheese and then these huge basil leaves. \\n\\nThat said, my husband's dish, which was a seafood soup, was AMAZING! It strongly reminded us of a delicious \\\"she-crab\\\" soup that we had had at an upscale \\\"low country\\\" restaurant in Vegas (now closed, sadly) \\n\\nMy second course was Littleneck clams with a shiso broth, eggplant, and shishito pepper. My husband had shrimp that were delicious as well. \\n\\nThe next course was softshell crab - it was pretty simply presented (I honestly can't even remember what came with it) The legs were the best part as they were crispy! It was a bit funny because the server described the crab by saying that \\\"HE is served with\\\"... made me a little sad to eat the little guy :) \\n\\nI had braised pork cheek for the next course, which was hands down my favorite course of the meal - super savory and flavorful. My husband had fried sweetbreads, which he said were a bit overdone - he didn't get much flavor other than \\\"fried\\\". \\n\\nWe had a fish course, which was okay - he had seared ahi tuna, I had a flaky white fish (cannot remember the name!!) \\n\\nOur meat course was interesting - hubby had the kangaroo prepared with ginger sauce - it was definitely a tougher meat, which is to be expected considering the animal. The flavor was sweet and very unique. It reminded me of elk or venison. I had the New York Strip served with a risotto. The steak was tasty but a VERY small portion 2 slices of 2\\\" x 1/2\\\" x 1/4\\\" (remember, I like small portions! This was just a bit too small -when you are serving wagyu or kobe beef that are very rich with fat, it makes sense to serve a tiny portion, but with regular beef, there's not a good reason to be so skimpy!) \\n\\nThe desserts were just okay - a dulce de leche flan and a white chocolate mousse with a raspberry gelee. They tasted well enough, but they weren't really up my ally texturally - both were very mushy and neither had anything crunchy/crispy/cookie-y with them. \\n\\nI ordered a mocktail at the start of the meal - a fruity pomegranate soda. It was good - very sweet, but good. However, one of my first dishes included a garlic chip, which the server had described as a sunchoke chip. I took a large bite of it, and while I don't mind garlic, it meant that I was tasting garlic for the entire rest of the meal! I had a hard time drinking the very sweet soda as it didn't combine well with the garlic flavor. Also, a warning - three of our dishes included garlic chips of some sort. \\n\\nNow, this last bit will sound nitpicky and weird, but it totally impacted my experience: the silverware is really BIG! This made it difficult to compose dainty bites with various elements from the dishes, and was especially weird considering how petite the food is in general. \\n\\nSo, all that said, I did really enjoy our meal! It is a lovely restaurant and the service was great! The food was pretty good and the surprise of each course made it lots of fun. We've had tasting menus in many upscale restaurants and I feel like Posh's pricing makes it a value - a similar length menu at one of the nice restaurants in Vegas would run $100 or more.\n"

As a matter of fact, this and the Superstition Springs one were the two I went to.\\n\\nAbout maybe 11 years ago, we went to the S. Springs location.  We went there probably once a month and enjoyed it each time.  Until one day, we noticed the rotisserie chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  All my mom did was ask the waiter to tell the cook that the chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  Then they got the manager and he scolded us saying \\\"Well, you guys are just trying to get a free meal\\\"  After a little big of an argument (mellow on my mom's side) we left.  Last time I ever been to one.. until a couple weeks ago.\\n\\nAnyways, enough about the past.  Went here for a lunch one day, just, you know, see if it changed at all.  Walked in the door and totally remember the winding entrance (be quiet, it's nostalgia for me).  Were greeted and seated right away.  I remember the big drink station in the middle.  There were a lot of tables of course, then I looked at the buffet.  \\\"Wheres all the food?\\\"  I know it was lunch time, but the buffet was way small.  I've been to dozens of buffet's since this place and this place is childs play compared to others.  \\n\\nThe quality of the food is pretty much the same since I last remembered, maybe a slight less.
