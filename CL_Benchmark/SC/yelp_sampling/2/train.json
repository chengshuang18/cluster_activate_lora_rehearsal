I appreciated her getting back to me so quickly and her willingness to fit me into their schedule. That was about the extent of any positive experience I had with them.\\n\\nI was given an arrival time of 2-3 pm. At 3, the owner contacted me saying the girls were running about half an hour late...no big deal. At 4:15, no one had come yet. I was then called by the crew saying they had run out of gas and would have to reschedule. I said that would not be possible because the reason I needed the cleaning done that day was because we were moving in the following day. They said they would try to get on the road and figure something out. At 6 pm they finally arrived. The girls were very sweet but on top of everything that had happened, I was expecting a thorough cleaning. They did a great job on the bathrooms but I felt everything else was either brushed over or not noticed at all. One reason we needed cleaning was because the previous tenants had a dog with very long hair. At the end of our cleaning, there was still hair and dirt on the \\\"mopped\\\" kitchen floor, the inside of the fridge, freezer and cabinets had not been touched. I don't know if my experience was a fluke but it added a lot of anxiety to an already stressful week. My husband and I have spent the last three days cleaning what should have already been a clean townhouse. I still ended up paying what I would have if the correct appointment time had been kept and at the end of all of it, I received an e-mail saying if I did a Yelp review I would receive $20 off my next appointment. So here I am, writing my review. Although I do not anticipate using my discount because I will not be using this company again.\n"

I have been desperate to check them out but my husband isn't one for tapas so we never made it a priority.  This past Friday I was able to enjoy my tapas in peace because I dined with three other ladies that were more than willing to try everything!  It was perfect!!  We arrived on Friday around 7:30 and were seated within about 30 minutes, which isn't bad considering they don't take reservations.\\n\\nThe waitress was super helpful in guiding us through the menu and gave us some suggestions.  Some of the plates are really best for 2 people and others were enough for the 4 of us to share.  We tried so many different things I don't even know where to start.  I will just break it down dish by dish:\\n\\nBroccoli Raab--Very good, refreshing, flavored well, served chilled, not too bitter\\nArugala--Strawberries, pine nuts, and goat cheese...can you even go wrong?\\nCheese plate--Meh.  I mean blue cheese made an appearance, really?  Come on.\\nFalafel--Scrumptious...4 little falafel nuggets.  Left me panting for more..so good.\\nRisotto--Not sure what flavors were combined to make this yummy goodness but it was on point\\n\\nGnocchi--With RABBIT.  Yup, I ate rabbit.  First time ever folks.  The gnocchi was excellent.  The rabbit was tender and flavorful.  It was not doubt gamey but blended well with the other flavors.  It was a table favorite.\\n\\nSteamed Bun--This one has the most hype around it but it wasn't necessarily our favorite.  The pork was so tough and the flavors were ok but it wasn't THAT great.\\n\\nMussels--My first time trying Mussels!  I don't have anything to compare these to but the others were loving these mussels.  They were in a green curry sauce and they were served with soft, warm, naan.  We all started dipping the bread in the sauce afterwards...and we even ordered more naan.  It was very good!!\\n\\nPork tenderloin--Another group favorite..so tender, full of flavor, served with a soft piece of cornbread.  Very good!!\\n\\nWe wrapped up our pigfest by grubbing down a brownie served with biscoff icecream.  The brownie was warm with chocolate chips...it was thin, not very moist, just okay in my opinion.  The icecream was very creamy.  We licked the plate, don't let me fool you.\\n\\nOverall--great experience.  Atmosphere is loud and crowded but energizing.  I love the hustle in this place.  People are eating well and are satisfied!  Prices are a little high but the quality of food makes it worth it.  I'll be back no doubt!\n"

Perhaps because the weather was gross or that we came smack in the middle of the afternoon, Bang Bang was really quiet. It gave me a chance to appreciate their decor and choice of music (Sinatra was on). It's a nice, cozy place with a warm interior. I dig that. \\n\\nWe tried the cheeseburger eggrolls, the Hangover with regular fries, and the Brie burger with sweet potato fries. We were really surprised at how well the cheeseburger eggrolls turned out. My only advise there is to make sure you order enough and wait a moment for them to cool. Hubs had the Hangover burger and let me try a bite. I liked it. I wish it just had a couple pieces of crispy whole bacon to round it off. My Brie burger was awesome. The tomato jam was sweet and mellow which really complements the brie and arugula. Normally I don't dig big wads of greens on my burger, but this stack was well balanced and tender, so it was pleasant. I think my one regret was getting a single because the Duke's Bread buns are a little too bulky to carry just one patty. Then again, I couldn't even finish my food (which is saying a lot considering I'm a fluffy girl in the Gabriel Iglesias sense), so that's probably more reflective of the bun just being too big. All these were good.......but the sweet potato fries with maple sauce....those were great. I can't really pin down why the sauce is so perfect. It's sweet, but it's not frosting sweet. It's tangy, but not ketchup tangy. Ugh, IDK, but it's delicious with the salted sweet potato fries. The regular fries are top notch too, but getting great regular fries has really become a standard expectation these days. I like that this place offers so many healthy options too. It makes feeding a mixed palate group much easier (though you won't catch me wolfing down broccoli with garlic oil any time soon; in fact, that's the only thing GHWB and I agree on politically: no broccoli. I don't like it. Well except for Chinese broccoli, but that's another post.). \\n\\nSo final opinion is that this is definitely the best burger joint we've seen in CLT so far, but it could use a few improvements like smaller buns for singles and a build your own burger option on the menu.\n"

Got here around 11:30 after striking out at McCarran's rental car center.  \\n\\nThe salesperson helped us immediately but took FOREVER to find out how much the drop off fee would be.  My husband had a quote from Orbitz up on his phone - the drop fee was $160 and the total quote was for $262.  He came back to the desk and told us the best price out the door was $343.  OK, so I understand they have special rates that are only offered on these websites and they may not be able to extend them in-store, but once my husband showed him the Orbitz quote he quickly typed something into his computer and stated, \\\"I can get you down to $271.\\\"  Really?  Your best price was $343 and now it's $271?

What kind of circus is this??  \\n\\nFinally a nice employee came and pointed to a row of cars.  \\\"Choose one from that row,\\\" he said.  My friend chose the first car in the row - a fiat.  She'd booked an economy car and it certainly seemed small enough to be one but what the heck do we know about cars?

My friend was politely trying to point out to her all of the stains on the leather seats - coffee maybe?  \\\"Did anyone even clean the interior of this car?\\\" I wondered.  The woman then handed my friend the slip to sign and stated, in a somewhat snarky way, \\\"You somehow managed a very large upgrade. I don't know how you did it.\\\" My friend tells her that we were told to pick a car out from that row and she chose the first one.  Would she like us to return it and choose another?  She responded, \\\"No, I'm just saying... it's a good upgrade.  So... enjoy it.\\\"  Oh yeah.  Great big upgrade.  Shitbox with coffee stains inside lol.  I'm sure Fiats are very nice cars.  But obviously not when you rent them from fox. \\n\\nIf price is the ONLY reason you'd rent from here then you'll be pleased.  But you really are getting what you pay for.

Perhaps they should stick with chirashizushi instead of nigiri. I also didn't think the sushi rice was well prepared or that the fish was properly chilled (it seemed a tad warm). I was not impressed.\\n\\nAlong with the sushi we also had a cucumber and seaweed salad (actually, sunomono) which was surprisingly good.\\n\\nCompliments, however, to the wait staff as they were exceedingly attentive and food and drinks were served with a smile and promptly. The staff is probably what stopped me from leaving too quickly (the staff under previous management was always warm and welcoming and I miss them).\\n\\nNow for the food coming out of the kitchen: Another delightful surprise, it was well executed. It was obvious to me that the tempura recipe was slightly different than previously, but it was well done and not greasy. A few details were off-putting, though, there was no gobo root in the vegetable mix and far too many slices of potato, and this time, pieces of chicken, too, which were a little stringy, I'd rather have had an additional shrimp (the large prawns were cut in half lengthwise and served in individually making the serving seem more generous than it was).\\n\\nAlso since the new management, the prices have risen rather steeply: Una-ju (eel over rice) is up sharply and several other items went up as well. Given recent economic times and the rise in restaurant prices, I'm not sure this is entirely fair, but some of the prices went up rather surprisingly high. It is easy, with drinks, to run to over $30.00 per person.\\n\\nThe new restaurant menu is all over the place: It appears that the new owners have tried to keep the core menu, but other additions make it seem disorganized, as if they are trying to please too many. The new menu has Fried rice, bulgogki, tempura, nabeyaki. Fried rice? And, yes, something like an encyclopedia of sushi rolls (2 pages worth).\\n\\nI went to Kampai because it reminded me of restaurants when I was in Japan. It was not striving for fusion or pan-Asain cuisine, or tons of novelty - a new dish now and then, fine, but was a solid example of quietly typical Japanese cuisine; quality classic food and an intimate atmosphere rather than catering to western ideas of what sushi and Japanese food \\\"should\\\" be or giving into food fads. I was always gratified to see members of the local ex-pat Japanese community eating there. And now I don't know where to sate my addiction to Japanese cuisine. Any recommendations greatly appreciated, as I don't know if I will be back to the new Kampai.\n"

The thing about this theater is you can't get popcorn, soda or any food unless you order it from waitstaff that comes to your seat. The food is pretty similar to what it would be in a moderated price restaurant. They have $25 menu for two if your on a date, a lot less inexpensive then doing the two separately. Also Groupon has a killer deal 45% off for movies valid til August 15th. Basically makes your ticket $5. The seat selection comes down to office leather chairs and lounge chairs that don't recline with a classroom (can't coin the name Irina H. takes credit for that) desk come over the top. Like airplane seats in the 90s. Def make sure you take those. The two downfalls I will say is with all the waitstaff they have at least 15 ppl per screen for a non busy night, it took over 10 mins for someone to come by and take my order, while the light was on. I had to flag someone down to get their attention. As well as they almost forgot my soda (took another 15 mins; when they brought the popcorn in 3 mins).

While I was there, my teenage son wanted to look around.  I found an XBox360 for sale for $70 and a jacket for $10 that I decided to purchase.  I was not familiar with their policies because I have not shopped there before but have rather just donated.  So I asked the cashier about the XBOX and if it worked or not.  She said she didn't know so I asked if I bought it and it didn't work if I could return it.  She said that was no problem and I said, okay, well, I guess I have nothing to lose as long as I can bring it back if it doesn't work and return it for my money back --- I mean,come on, its an XBOX for $70, I figured it didn't work but thought, \\\"what the heck, If I can bring it back, why not?\\\".  The cashier, Jamie made me feel like it was safe to try.  I took it home and found that it did not work.  I took it back within one hour of purchasing it.  I was told by Ruth that they could only give me store credit.  I told her that Jamie had told me that I could get my money back if it didn't work.  Ruth told me that I should have been aware of their policy because it is posted in the store on a poster hanging above the entrance and on my receipt.  However, I would not have seen this unless I looked up or had already purchased it in order to have the receipt.  At that time, Jamie walked past me and I asked her why she had told me I could return it for my money back.  She said that she thought I could.  So I asked Ruth why, if an employee didn't know the policy, that I was expected to know it?  I told Ruth that I would like to speak to a manager.  She said that there wasn't one available and she would have them call me.  I asked when that would be and she didn't know.  I said, well should I just leave the purchases there and then decline the charges with my credit card.  She said what ever I did was up to me and was very rude.  I said that since she wasn't giving me any options I would just leave everything with her (including the jacket because I was going to try to get my money back from the credit card company).  So I left everything with her because I told her I would be contacting my card company to dispute the charge.  So I took a video of all the merchandise and Ruth taking it and making a note of it on the receipt (which she kept).  \\n\\nOne week later, Ruth called me to tell me she couldn't get her district manager to deal with the issue, nor to even call me.  She told me she could not give me his name or his phone number.  And that I would just need to deal with my credit card company with my issues.  \\n\\nMy credit card company denied the dispute because I had nothing in writing - my video was not suitable proof.  \\n\\nBefore writing this review I called and spoke with Ruth one last time to ask if I could please speak with the district manager because I planned to file a complaint with the BBB (WHICH BUYER BEWARE, THEY ARE NOT MEMBERS) if it could not be resolved.  She said he was on vacation.  And although she was unwilling to give her district manager's name or phone number.  She did tell me that she was given another district manager as their contact person while her manager is on vacation, whom I also wasn't able to reach (surprise, surprise) . \\n\\nHere are the key issues that I feel warrant this review and my claim to the BBB.  \\n#1) The fact is that I have spent $80 in a store and have no product(s) or services to show for it.   However, I do have a video showing me leaving everything with Ruth and vocalized everything happening in the video\\n#2)  The employee, Jamie TOLD me that I could return the XBOX if it didn't work for my money back and they should honor what they said.  Especially since I have been a great donator to this location.  It is very close to my house and I bring all of my children's outgrown clothes and toys as donations.  The irony of it all is that I actually donated more that $80 worth of items on the day that this horrendous customer service experience occurred.\\n#3)  The policy to only give back store credit, while posted in an area of the store - was not well known, because even their own employee was not aware of it.  Also, having it printed on the receipt is illogical because you don't get a receipt until the transaction is already done.  I don't think that my first trip purchasing something in the store should make me more aware of this policy than a store employee knows.\n"

The grilled eggplant ($8) consisted on half of an eggplant marinated in kind of a green papaya salad type dressing. The flavor combination was nice however the grilled eggplant was a little bit tough texturally. The stir-fried mushrooms ($8) consistent of 2-3 different mushrooms with a sliver of lotus root and 1 brussel sprout mixed in. You heard me -1 brussel sprout. There was too little wok hai to the dish and hence the dish was swimming in too much liquid. The flavor was alright but nothing special.\\n\\nThe braised pork belly ($8) had a nice melt in your mouth texture and good flavor. However there were only 5 small slices of meat to go around.\\n\\nThe kai tod (garlic fried chicken) was good ($10) and one of the surprisingly more reasonably priced items on the menu. They actually gave you a large portion of the cornish game hen. The meat itself was tender while the outside was crispy and well seasoned.\\n\\nPad see ew ($6) was one of their better dishes of the night - good flavor with some good crisping of the rice noodles. Their pad thai ($7) though was one of the worst dishes. It was a little unusual for the rice noodle dish to be completely encased in a omelet but we went with it. The omelet was a little bit tough from the overcooked egg while the noodles were completely bland. Not recommended.\\n\\nWe also ordered the steamed sea bass with the plum sauce ($18) which I found to be a little too sweet for my tastes. I would not order this again.\\n\\nMassaman curry ($9) had a nice flavor however was devoid of any real amount of vegetables or meat in the stew. Literally 2 chicken drumsticks, half of a raw small potato and perhaps half an onion.\\n\\nOh and about that raw potato -- so we informed the manager/owner? that the potato in the dish was raw. His response - \\\"but the chicken is cooked, right?\\\". \\\"Yes.\\\" And that was it. He did not offer to correct the problem or even acknowledged that it was an issue at all as long as the chicken was cooked.  He didn't even offer an apology for incorrectly cooked food. That is poor customer service and speaks to the inexperience of the staff that work there.\\n\\nAlthough I appreciate that we went on opening night, I have to say for really hit or miss quality Thai food (I would perhaps get maybe 3 out of the 8 items we ordered again) at over the top pricing for the small portions I would probably not return. However with the added poor service response, I would recommend avoiding this place like the f&*king bubonic plague. 2 starred review.\\n\\nAt the time we went, they didn't have a liquor license but they allowed BYOB without charging corkage fees. Woop de doo.\n"

We had an amazing female bartender that was all smiles and very personable. She happily put a game we wanted on a side TV for us and talked to us throughout the afternoon. I watched her make bloody mary after bloody mary, answer the phone, and manage to socialize with her customers. She was the epitome of a good bartender. The food was great, as well. This morning we both had wings and football on the brain and East Blvd is where we wanted to go. It wasn't busy when we walked in, 30 mins prior the game. The bartender didn't even greet us, but merely set a menu in front of us and said, \\\"What can I get you?\\\" Sure, I guess everyone isn't as personable as the last...but he just seemed as if everyone was a nuisance and an inconvenience. He acted as if he was swamped, and when we asked for a game on a side tv, he coldly said it would be a bit. At one point, a customer was joking about the phones ringing off the hook, and he fired back \\\" Would you rather I answer the phone or pour your beer?\\\" Never cracked a smile, couldn't even muster a \\\"you're welcome\\\" following a customer's thank you...I mean, why be a bartender? Every single patron at the bar noticed his poor attitude. I am not writing this with the intention of trying to get anyone fired, and I have only ever written a review on yelp one other time, and it was a good one. But come on! The energy at a bar on football Sunday should be high. I shouldn't feel afraid to ask a question about the menu. On the contrary, he was attentive and I always had a drink in front of me. But personality as a bartender is a key quality. This gentleman did not display this quality in the least.

Even though I would have accepted having one thumb nail polish looking a bit off I'm glad she wanted to fix it cause it took the pressure off me. I think my one regret is not having more money to tip (it's cash only). I gave a nice tip, but wanted to over do it a bit cause she was so good.\n"

        "sentence": "Text: Overall our experience using Dollar Rent A Car in Charlotte was mixed. The service at the rental place, particularly the shuttle driver, Jim Body, was great. We got excellent rates using Orbitz. Our car was very clean and worked great and despite not having their insurance we did not run into any problems when returning the vehicle.\\n\\nThe only thing that went wrong was that when we had to change our pickup date, they changed the daily rates on us to double the price. I had to drive back to the rental lot to switch out cars to get a lower rate, which was a major inconvenience and I still ended up paying more. So watch out for that if you need to change either your pickup date or drop off date. \\n\\nIn working out that problem I had to call several different representatives for Dollar. The first was very rude and unhelpful. However, the other person I talked to, Joey, was very helpful and helped me find the solution to my problem.\n"

We ordered dishes that never arrived.  For the price and location, not to mention other reviews on yelp - I thought this place would be a hidden gem, I was truly disappointed.  \\n\\nI did step away towards the end to mention that we had been unable to order additional drinks and food, and sort of complained that we were very disappointed - no apology or anything.\n"

We both enjoyed the gourmet buns....thought it brought the burgers up a notch. The service was fast and friendly. For a burger joint our meal was a bit pricey...but hey this is Vegas and a meal for two under thirty bucks is kinda a bargain.\n"
