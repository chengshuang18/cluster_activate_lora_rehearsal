        "sentence": "Text: I came here to give it a try and chose the 3 course Prix fixe menu which consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert.  I was surprised by how small the restaurant was inside.  There's more seating in the hallway that leads to the rear tower of the Tropicana Hotel.  I decided to eat inside because there had been a whole lot of people rolling suitcases down that hall and I wanted a little more quiet. The restaurant inside is almost all white.\\n\\nThe bread basket was brought quickly.  A couple of things here.  The bread was very dry, stale even, and the mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar is just the wrong shape for this dipping sauce.  There's way too much olive oil and the balsamic just sits at the bottom.  The basket had a piece of lavash, some focaccia, a roll, and a slated bread stick.  The star of that basket was the salted bread stick.\\n\\nFor a main course, I got the linguini with Manilla clams in a white wine sauce.  There were 10 clams arranged around the pasta.  This was excellent.  I wanted to drink the sauce left, but I used some of the bread to soak up the white wine sauce and I finished it that way.  For those who don't like salty foods, I could taste a fair amount of salt in the sauce.  I love salt so this was a good thing.  Others need to be warned about that.\\n\\nFor dessert, I got the tiramisu.  This was a very large piece of tiramisu different from what I've generally had, but it was very tasty.  On top was a lot of cocoa powder which set off the sweetness beneath.\\n\\nThe prix fixe menu gives you coffee or tea and a glass of house wine.  I got iced tea and instead of wine, I had a cup of coffee with dessert.  At most places, that would cause fits and an extra charge.  Here it was just fine!\\n\\nI was going to give Bacio 3.5 stars, but shortly after I was seated, Chef Pellegrino had a meltdown with one of her staff--enough so that most people in the restaurant looked where she was and watched and listened.  She was giving grief to one of her bus people for wasting bread.  The meltdown ended with her saying, \\\"That costs money.\\\"  She walked out of the restaurant for a few moments and then came back.  The show was worth an extra 1/2 star.  Brava!  The service by all the staff was superb!\\n\\nI do have one complaint.  The French term for your kind of menu, Chef Pellegrino, is Prix fixe as you well know.  Please don't be lazy and spell it prefix like many people do who have no clue as to the origin of the term.  I know it sounds like prefix but don't succumb to dumbing down your own menu because people don't know.\\n\\nChef Pellegrino is very talented.  She was working in the kitchen all the time I was there.  Obviously she cares.  I am sure I'll make a return visit!\n"

If you know Filipino cuisine, you know that most dishes take at least an hour to cook and it varies from province to province. In addition, it's not as aesthetically pleasing to eye as other foods.

Second, the food was served in an appealing manner. I ordered the Laing which is a coconut based soup/stew and light pink/purple in color but it was served in a bowl lined with banana leaves which boosted the aesthetics.

So my standards are high and my comments might not represent the masses.\\n\\nFirst let's talk about the service. The waitresses were less than friendly/ professional. One of them interrupted my boyfriend when he was asking her a question. When I asked her what was in a particular dish, she said, \\\"exactly as it says on the menu: beef, onions, peppers, etc.\\\". I wondered if I looked blind or illiterate to her? Then when I asked her to heat up a soup dish because it was cold, she said \\\"well, it shouldn't be cold, because it just came off the stove\\\". I guess she either likes her soup cold, or she doesn't understand the difference between \\\"putting it on the stove\\\" and \\\"serving the soup after it boils\\\". It took her forever to take the soup back out to us. Shortly after we were done, she dropped the check on our table without saying anything. When we had to wait for change, she took so long we had to go up to the counter to ask for it. \\n\\nNow let's talk about the food. Before I went to Bandung, I asked my Indonesian friend and my other friend who works there for suggestions. So naturally, I ordered the \\\"authentic\\\" and \\\"best dishes\\\" of the house: SATE KAMBING (marinated lamb skewers with rice cakes), RED CURRY SQUASH, and SOTO AYAM (lemon grass flavored broth with chicken breast, bean sprouts, green onion, egg and mung bean noodle). \\n\\nWell, the Sate Kambing and Soto Ayam came out COLD, which they were NOT supposed to be. There was way too much sauce on the lamb, and the portion is very small for it's price ($12.95 for 6 tiny skewers). Also, the rice cake was very lumpy and mushy. I could barely tell that it was rice. The Soto Ayam was way too salty. Red curry squash was ok, but I could have had this dish at any Thai- or Asian-inspired restaurants. Meh.\\n\\nThis is one of the few situations when bad service coupled with worse-than-average food truly ruined my evening. I was very excited about going to an Indonesian restaurant and I went home completely unsatisfied and disappointed.\n"

She was not too impressed.  Thinking that her hopes were high because she was a big Rick Moonen fan, I tried her sushi and was also not pleased.  It looked spicy as described on the menu but didn't have much of a kick.  She should have ordered something that said Rick Moonen in front of it because the Cioppino was excellent and recommended as a fan of seafood.  We tried the Ahi Tuna Duo for an appetizer that was so-so and the Key Lime pie for desert which was meh (both off the prix fixe menu).  Probably wouldn't go for those a second time.\\n\\nThe venue is great, set back slightly from the Mandalay Bay casino floor just to give you enough of a reminder that you are still in Vegas.  We ate downstairs which is perfect for a casual date and not too loud. Rick Moonen apparently knows seafood and the accolades donning every inch of the walls suggest that Rick Moonen is fully aware that he knows seafood.

So my assessment is that: SHOKU RAMEN-YA doesn't have a good bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen...SHOKU has a GREAT bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu. \\n\\nThings have changed a lot here in the last month. I came here over a month ago during their soft opening,  and the manager was still training the cooks and servers to be more proficient. Today when I came to SHOKU, everything had been perfected. I have to congratulate the new manager(Ehren) for working non-stop around the clock, and dedicating his whole life into turning this place into one of the best Ramen-Yas in Las Vegas. The flavor of the Hakata Tonkotsu was a world of difference from last month! You can really taste the pork bones and marrow from them preparing the broth all day long in that traditional Kyushu style. \\n\\nThe Charsu has changed as well. It's very soft, fatty, and tender like the ones you get at Onizuka Street. I loved it! \\n\\nUnlike 99% of the Ramen-Yas in LV, SHOKU actually has a Hanjuku Egg as one of their add ons. This is big! This really BIG!  Monta, Sora, and Shuseki only have normal medium-boiled eggs. A Hanjuku egg needs a lot of work to prepare correctly. It needs to be boiled for exactly 7 minutes to preserve it's extremely runny nature, then it must be instantly placed into ice water or the egg will continue to cook itself and the yolk will be ruined.Afterwards it's transferred to a mixture of shoyu, sugar, and sometimes vinegar. It will then be marinated for many hours. SHOKU is the only Ramen-Ya in Vegas that features this style of egg. It's a very rare delicacy here in LV. \\n\\nThe Bacon Fried rice was the best Japanese fried rice I have ever had. Better than Monta...Better than Yagyu Yakinku..Better than Shuseki. The Bacon Rice here at SHOKU RAMEN-YA is a perfect fusion blend of flavors. It has the buttery qualities of Hibachi Fried Rice(ex-Benihana), but with much stronger and unique added flavors. Because SHOKU is a Bachi Burger spinoff, their cooks do fusion better than anyone. \\n\\nThe manager of this restaurant told me that in a few weeks they will add Tan Tan Men onto the menu.

I've been to every major Ramen-ya on the westcoast and only like 8 of them had Tan Tan Men. For those who don't know, Tan Tan Men is a very difficult dish to master for any chef. That's why there are Ramen-Yas that specifically specialized in ONLY Tan Tan Men. I've been to Chinese-Japanese Ramen houses where TTM was the only thing on the menu because the chef needed to put all his attention in only that one thing. I can't wait to see the SHOKU variation of Tan Tan Men. Ehren is one of the most talented restaurant managers in Las Vegas, and I'm confident that his staff can master this difficult variation. \\n\\nI encourage all the Nisei, Sansei, and Yonsei to come eat here, especially if you are from Hawaii. Every Japanese born in Hawaii I have spoken to have told me that SHOKU is one of the best Ramen-Yas on the mainland. There is something about the flavors here at SHOKU that make Hawaiians happy. I know that many of my Japanese-Hawaiian Yelp friends would love this place. \\n\\nAlso, remember that this is a Kyushu style Ramen-Ya so it would be a travesty to order something that wasn't Tonkotsu. You don't go to a Sapporo Ramen house and not order the Miso. You don't got to a Tokyo Ramen house and not order the Shoyu. You don't go to a Chinese-Japanese Ramen house and not order the Tan Tan Men. And you defiantly should not go to a Hakata Ramen-Ya and not get the Tonkotsu. Tonkotsu is the signature dish of Hakata, Kyushu.\n"

The resort is very beautiful and we had a very lovely view from our suite on the 33rd floor. \\n\\nThe resort got my name incorrect on the account despite my husband put it on the reservation. My name is Kimberly and they listed me as Kira(?) not even close. This did cause a problem when I tried to charge my breakfast to the room the day my husband had to go to conference early. Luckily I had my Military ID that listed him as my husband because I had not brought a purse with me (no charge cards).\\n\\nThe room has all of these high tech toys, that just never worked right. I wouldn't want them in my room but they came with the suite. If you give me a toy and it doesn't work you just lost points. \\n\\nOur TV located in bathroom did not work for the three days we were there despite turning it in every morning as \\\"not working at all\\\" to the front desk! Do I need a TV in bathroom? Not really but you have it in there so it should work, am I right?\\n\\nThe volume on the living room TV did not work when we got there and they sent a nice maintenance guy up to look at it. The cable had broken off in some black box thingy that provided the sound. He said it happens all the time but he could put the sound back to the TV and they could replace the cable the following day. If a problem can be described as \\\"it happens all the time\\\" then you have a system failure and the problem should be addressed as such. Different cable, different sound box, educate the cleaning staff, or whatever makes the \\\"all the time\\\" stop! The cable might have been replaced but the sound continued to come out of the TV and was at a good level of sound - this was great because after that the sound could not be adjusted with the TV remote anymore. Now this is becoming a bang head here moment. \\n\\nThe light switches at our bedside tables were reversed. I control my reading lamp and my husband' s table lamp. I turned this in as a problem the first day but it was never fixed and I had other things to do than sort out their mechanical mess ups. \\n\\nIt is essential when travel to have a coffee pot in our room. We wake usually very early as we live on the east coast and wit the time difference- we can be up at 6am no problem. They call my husband back and said they have no coffee pots??? really? A resort your size and the price we are paying per night for our room and no coffee pots! Someone should go shopping for a few Keurig coffee pots and have them for guests who ask for them!! That would be a very small investment which would quickly provide a great ROI both in good will and giving the customer (remember us) what we want -coffee if we wake up at 6am. My husband woke at 6:30 our first morning and went to the Skyview suites' lounge and was told he could go out to Starbucks or another coffee place. My husband had his robe and slippers on??!! Who trains these people?! Did he look like he was dressed forgoing out in the main area of the hotel. It was bad enough you were making him come down 33 floors for a cup of coffee.\\n\\nThe casino area was pro-ported to be a special area that even if someone was smoking the indoor air quality would be just fine. I am allergic to cigarette smoke - it was most unpleasant and cigars are always the worse. They should confine all cigars to a cigar smoking area, don't let them just walk around with them. \\n\\nHousekeeping did a wonderful job - everything was spotless. The turn down service was excellent. The furnishing were nice. The bed was very fluffy and the pillows were comfortable. The view was breath taking. The water and apples were nice in the Skyview Suite lounge. I don't drink soda and they had no limes for the Sparkling water. \\n\\nMaybe I am just getting spoiled in my old age but I have stay in as nice or nicer suites for a lot less money. I want coffee when I want it! And in my room, not 33 floors below me. I do not like cigarette or cigar smoke period.\\n\\nThey escort you to your room -this is a frequent comment that people are impressed by. They need to get out more often, most places we stay do this. I am turned off by people who have to try to impress you. \\n\\nI wouldn't stay here again and I won't be back to Vegas. For the Aria our room number was 33022 so maybe you can get the problems with the TV and bedroom lights fixed before you put anyone else in there.\n"

We were spread out all over the hotel so many of us had good experiences, however, I did not.  \\n\\nThe first room I was put in did not have hot water and it looked as if it had not been remodeled since 1970.  After a cold shower I went downstairs and asked what the problem was.  I was told that it was the entire hotel and it would only be for about and hour.  I then met my coworkers for dinner and asked if they had hot water.  They all had hot water!  Hmm somthing didn't add up.\\n\\nSo the next morning I was still in bed and my roomate comes out of the shower furious because the water was still cold.  I went downstairs to complain so they switched us to another room that looked like it was from 1970 only this time there were pubic-looking hairs all over the floor and the bathtub faucet wouldn't shut off.  We were already late to work so we had no time to switch again.\\n\\nWhen we returned from work the elevators opened and the entire floor was under constuction except our room which we were locked out of.  I called the front desk and the came and gave us a key.  We then asked about the running water and they said there was nothing they could do.\\n\\nSo after all this I went to the front desk and put my foot down, so I got a apology and was put in an \\\"upgraded\\\" room (meaning that it had been updated in the past 20 years) .\\n\\nThe hotel offered to do nothing for us except give us a dinner for 2 at their crappy Mexican restaurant that I had eaten at the night before.
