I read the reviews and got an AMAZING deal from Orbits ($45/Night) so I figured even if the worst review was true, it would still be worth the Super 8 Rate I was paying.  \\n\\nWhen we walked into our room (7207) I was immediately reminded of the review that said the room \\\"smelled like a dirty diaper\\\". I had completely forgot about that, and honestly if i hadn't experienced the same exact thing, I probably would have chalked it up to a nit-picky reviewer. I mean, rooms can't smell like dirty diapers!? How is that possible?  Oh, but it is. When i saw that his room (7211) was in the same little room cul-de-sac as ours, I knew we basically had the same experience.\\n\\nIn retrospect I really wish I would have asked to change rooms, but we checked in late and really had to start getting ready for dinner so I just hoped it would be one of those musty smells you get used to and forget about.  I wasn't too pleased with the fact that the first decision of our vacation was whether we could get used to the funky room smell or not.\\n\\nOther than that, everything was pretty nice. I liked the look of the room, the ceilings were wooden with horizontal beams which gave it a kind of cool rustic effect.  Also, the bed faced the huge patio doors, which made the room seem big and open.  The prices everywhere, including the minibar, were reasonable. We didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't say anything about that, but both bartenders we had at the bars were really friendly.\\n\\nThe cookies upon check-in were so good!  That may have been the highlight of the stay.  Not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. Overall, for the price I paid I really can't complain.

I called and scheduled an apt with Dr. DelRosso. Not knowing there were 6 different locations, I assumed it was at the address that was listed with the phone number that I called. The man that took my apt over the phone not only was extremely rude but failed to tell me about the numerous locations. Therefore, I was late to my apt and had to drive all the way to Henderson from Centennial Hills to be seen. Here's the part that pissed me off the most. The dr looked me over and said thank you, and walked out. I asked the nurse what was going on and she said that I have to come back in two to three weeks to get everything I need done. Are you kidding me?! It gets better.. They had me pay a copay when I clearly showed them that I do NOT have one. Got that reimbursed from my insurance due to their incompetence. Now I'm here, three weeks later. I check in and they tell me that I now owe $100! Excuse me?!? I called the office YESTERDAY to confirm and let them know of new insurance and they said great see you tomorrow. And now I get a surprise of the $100. After patronizing me for the money acting like they know more about my insurance than I do, they called them and what do you know, I owe nothing. The Dr will DEFINITELY be hearing from me. Who knows, it's probly going to get worse when I get back in a room. But with the 45 min I've already been waiting, it might be a while.\n"

Between you and me day drinking isn't one of my strong suits and has to be justified for me to do it.\\n\\nA great happy hour not only starts early but allows you enjoy well priced libations and food at great prices. That's when great happy hour specials come into play, such as at the recently discovered 5th and Wine in Old Town Scottsdale. Opened by the same owners as the fantastic Humble Pie and the new Living Room Wine Bar in Chandler, they create a space that's welcoming, relaxed and comfortable. Service is polished with an attractive and eager staff that seem genuine and friendly.\\n\\nDay drinkers can delight from 3pm-7pm daily, including weekends, with 5th & Wines great happy hour with glasses of wine priced at $5. The deals don't stop there, also offering a short list of fantastic draft beers and well drinks both at only $4.\\n\\n5th and Wine also offers several well priced appetizers to pair up with one of their amazing wines. Salty cured meats always taste so good while sipping drinks, and the Prosciutto Wrapped Breadsticks ($4) filled the ordered perfectly. They take long thin bread sticks then wrap them with thin slices of cured pork and finish them horseradish cream, incredibly addictive.\\n\\nServed with crunchy jicama and ranch dressing for dipping, the Spicy Chicken Drumettes ($4) might be the best deal on the menu. In total there were 12 plump and meaty drumettes that were cooked until tender then slathered in a spicy vinegary wing sauce, basic I know but executed perfectly.\\n\\nThe center piece to all of the eating and drinking were definitely the Bruschetta ($9.95 for 6). Starting with a thick slab of toasted artisan bread, you choose from 8 different preparations ranging from mild to sublime. Standouts included a tasty peppercorn crusted steak with dollops of nose clearing creamy horseradish and for the wine centric, apples with brie and fig jam which was then drizzled with honey and agave syrup. After trying so many, my absolute favorite had prosciutto, mascarpone cheese, figs and tomato jam. Salty, sweet, creamy and chewy, this touched on everything I love about well prepared Bruschetta.\\n\\nAt these prices you can easily put together a hearty meal but why stop there? 5th and Wine also offers a great selection of salads, sandwiches entrees and daily specials on their regular menu.\\n\\nNot to be missed, the 5th and Wine Burger ($11.95) starts with all natural ground beef then is topped with Cambozola or White Cheddar, caramelized onions and organic arugula. I opted for the addition of an organic fried egg for only $1.50 more which added the creaminess of hot egg yolk to each beefy bite. Almost as good as the burger, the 5th Ave Sausage ($10.95) uses Schreiner's sausage, caramelized onions, roasted peppers, arugula and whole grain mustard on toasted focaccia. However on my last visit, like the burger, the sausage was served on tender flaky brioche, a perfect substitute.\\n\\nJust think in the time it took to read this another happy hour started.\n"

The cashier was extremely rude and looked at me like I was crazy asking if they had a child discount.  (they do but only for 8 and under which seems kind of rediculous but I highly recommend you go elsewhere with kids 9-18).\\n\\nSo we were finally seated, ordered our drinks and went to look around.  Although items appear to be grouped together by region of origin, there is no signage and the layout requires you to go around the carving station to get anywhere.  \\n\\nMy first impression of the food was that it looked good.  I was a bit put off that the cleanliness of the buffet area was so bad.  The setup often requires you to ladle across several items of food resulting in food on the counter and food mixed in with other food.  At most buffets, there are staff members promptly cleaning up the spillage but here i did not see that occur at all. In fact, between my first trip to the buffet and my second, some of the spills were still there.\\n\\nSpecific issues - the pita was hard as a rock, the rolls were stale, the meat overcooked, Everything appeared to have excessive grease.  The oriental food was utterly flavorless (although the pad thai was servicable if less than a 1 in spice level)\\n\\nWhen we got back to our table, there were tiny flying creatures around, I had to kill at least two.  I barely ate any of the items on the first plate and went back for a second trip only because i had paid $25.00 and wanted to at least find something edible.  I got mac and cheese and fruit on the second trip.   The fruit was fresh but not quite ripe on the melons and poorly cut as there was rind on several pieces.  The mac and cheese was actually good.  Very cheesey and with cheddar flavored cheese sauce instead of the usual american.\\n\\nThe place wasn't very busy but we didn't see our server to refill our drinks until we were almost done with the food.  My daughter, who usually loves buffets, only took sushi which she said wasn't very good, and spaghetti and watermelon.  Normally she makes a second trip but she was complaining her stomach hurt by the end of the meal and didn't even eat a desert. (we did get one to take with us which she ate 1/2 of in the car.)\\n\\nUnder our table was food from the previous customer (I know because neither I or my daughter had the spring rolls.)\\n\\nAll in all it was a huge disappointment.

We used to love this place but we will not set foot in there again unless something seriously changes! The foot long burrito used to be $4.99 now it's it's $6.99 with bad meat!\n"

They have the best selection of beers, which flow through all the pipes you see on the ceiling.The Belgian sampler in particular was fun to try and share with each other as we compared which flavors we liked best (my favorite was Blanche de Bruxelles!). The rib eye with string beans and mashed potatoes was perfect & satisfying. We had Ben as out waiter and he was really attentive and nice. Keep in mind that the place does get busy, and there's typically a wait time, but it's worth it.\n"

Broccoli Beef\\ne. All above but with brown rice\\nf. Steamed Rock Cod with scallion, oil and soy sauce.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you picked \\\"F\\\", then read on below.  If you picked a-e, then this place will be a THREE-STAR for you and you are better off going to PF Chang, Pei Wei or Panda.\\n\\nFor any of you picking \\\"F\\\", you will know this place is pretty darn good and well worth a 5 star.\\n\\na.  The place - This place is a just the right size. Perhaps 10 -11 tables and also a separated area with two very large banquet tables. I can see this place would be busy at dinners and for lunch it was just right.\\n\\nb.  The service - I know I was in a real cantonese place because of the service. I would have to classify it as indifferent efficiency.  However, that being said, I wanted to order something not on the menu and worked with them and they had it and they asked me if it was the way I liked it. Also it was not too busy.\\n\\nc.  The FOOD -\\n\\n- You know you are in the right place when at the front door is a large fish tank with dozens of rock cod in the tank and also another tank with huge geoduck in it.  Yeah baby.  Let's get ready to rock it.\\n\\n- Rock Cod steamed - This s essentially a key fish in cantonese cuisine, at least in my book.  The rock cod themselves have rather large bones and is perfect to steam. The meat is just the right texture and when you add the scallion, oil and soy sauce, the smell, the taste, the natural sauce, it is absolutely the best.\\n\\n- Bitter Melon with spare ribs in black bean sauce - Now listen here all, you know you are in a great place if they serve bitter melon. How many people would normally order bitter melon.  If this was served at Panda, it would never be sold. but here, my goodness, it was great. The melon was just right, firm, not crunchy. The black bean sauce was just the right amount ant the ribs were cut to about an inch or so and was perfect!  When I first moved to LV, I could not find this at any Chinese restaurant so I learned how to make it and at KJ, I love it!\\n\\n- Steamed Chicken with Scallion and Ginger - Now I did not see this on their menu, and they had similar items that were fried, but I needed mine the authentic steamed method. I asked the waitress if they had this after I attempted to describe it and she knew exactly what I wanted and they brought it out.  The half chicken order was perfect. Tons of shredded scallion on top of the chicken that had a very thin layer of skin which means, awesome tasting proper chicken baby!  Yep, the best chicken for this is the not so thick and meaty chicken, but the bony rather emaciated chicken that have a wonderful taste. This dish was just perfect and I had to have extra ginger sauce as it was so good. \\n\\nd.  Overall - You know you are in a really authentic Cantonese restaurant when you see the following:\\n\\n- The Shovel Method - Yep, that is right.  You shovel the rice from a bowl into your mouth with chopsticks. You do NOT try to pick the rice up, you are NOT dainty, you are NOT polite.  You SHOVEL the morsels of rice into your mouth.  By the way, no soy sauce on the rice.  When you are eating Cantonese style, you are putting the food in your plate or your rice bowl and the fragrant and tasty juices of the dishes are absorbed by your rice. Much tastier than soy sauce.\\n\\n- The Boney Plates.  Yeah, not \\\"china\\\" plates but BONEY plates. Yep, true Cantonese people love their meats on the bone.  The bonier the better.  You will hear some sucking and some crunching, gnawing and jawing, however, the best visual is a plate piled with bones stripped clean like a piranha attacked it!\\n\\n- Oh yeah, no silverware.  Come on.  How can anyone eat Cantonese with a fork and knife is beyond me.  BTW, isn't it funny to see so many people at other restaurants eating Chinese food on an american style plate trying to use a chopstick?   I use silverware when eating in Chinese restaurants that do not have bowls.  Shovel method.  That is the way to go!\\n\\nGK says, check this place out. If you see someone making a ton of noise and gushing all over the bones on his plate.  Check him out. That could be ME!\n"

I actually ate at Firefly for the first time years ago when my wife and I were visiting with our friends and were guided here by an old high school friend that lives in LV now.  Prior to eating at Firefly, my wife and I had never had Tapas.  Being in town for CES last weekend with the same friends that came the first time, they requested to revisit Firefly for a dinner and we obliged.\\n\\nWhen my wife found out that they wanted to come back, she had a feeling of discomfort associated with the restaurant that should couldn't really place the reason behind at the time.  But as soon as we walked in, it came back to her; she didn't like sitting at the lounge table.  For those of you who have not been before, be aware that there is a bar, a set of normal tables with chairs and booth seats, and then a number of tables surround by low couches that require leaning over a lot to eat.  We requested a normal dining table this time to appease her, and it made all the difference.\\n\\nWhen we arrived on Thursday night after our first day at CES, it was already pretty hopping.  We put our names down for a table and went to the bar.  I remembered having the Sangria last time, but didn't remember how good it was.  I asked the bar tender if I could try the red wine Sangria (effectively ordering it), but then he actually made a mini version of the drink with fruit bits and all for me to try it.  I then asked to try the white and champagne Sangrias (meeting more and more resistance each time, understandably) before ordering the champagne version.  The fact that he was wiling to let me sample all three was greatly appreciated.  Great bar tender.  My wife ordered a Mojito (so-so), and then a couple caramel apple martinis because they blew her away.  Highly recommended.\\n\\nSoon we were told a table was available for us and we sat at a comfortable, standard table.  Here is what we ordered (that I can recall) and our impressions:\\n\\nShrimp ceviche - Nice shrimp, but way too citrusy (sour).\\n\\nStuffed dates - A great blend of sweet and savory (dates + bacon).\\n\\nFrench Fries - A great filler. Shoestring with Parmesan and herbs. Ask for aioli to dip in.\\n\\nManchego Mac 'n Cheese - A favorite for my wife (the mac 'n cheese connoisseur).  Very good and cheesy.\\n\\nTerra y Mare Skewers - Tasty and good quality filet, shrimp, and chorizo.\\n\\nChicken and Chorizo stuffed mushrooms - Sizzling awesomeness.  They're hot when they first come out, so be careful.\\n\\nLamb skewers - Very good and tender.\\n\\nFried calamari - I don't like squid, so I didn't really partake, but the other three said it was very good.\\n\\nCamarones a la diabla - Shrimp with a nice kick and a smoky sauce.  Good stuff.\\n\\nChocolate Tres Leches Cake - Amazing! Melts in your mouth. No chewing necessary.  Super soft and moist.  Drooling...\\n\\nWith the 10 entrees and multiple rounds of drinks, you'd think the bill would be nuts, but it was around $150 total, which is perfectly reasonable for 4 people given the quality, variety, and quantity.  I recommend you check this place out if you want a great tapas experience.  There's a nice cigar bar in the same strip mall, too.\\n\\nSummary: Great food. Very reasonable prices.  High quality.  Full bar.  Lots of parking.  Place gets hopping at night, so come early or plan for a wait.  Great bar service and drinks.  Lounge seating and normal tables.  Lounge seats require leaning forward a lot.  Highly recommended restaurant.\n"
