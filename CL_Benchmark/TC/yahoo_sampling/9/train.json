        "sentence": "Question: Any tips on how to lose weight (the healthy way) Please let me know?.?\nAnswer: My theory: everything in moderation.\\n\\nDon\"t deny yourself. People who obsess about what they eat generally give up quickly. If you really want ice cream, have ice cream. Not \"once a week\". Just when you REALLY want it. But before you choose a high-calorie, low-nutrition food, think about it.\\n\\n1. You should be eating six small meals a day - not three large ones. Even if you arn't really hungry, sit down and eat a small meal. Eat at 8, 10, 12, 3, 6 and 8. And if you want to snack between, and don't think you can wait, go ahead. And I fully endorse a bed-time snack.\\n\\n2. When you eat, eat foods that will keep you full. ie: whole grains.\\n\\n3. If you want that snack in-between, but arn't sure you need it, drink an 8 oz glass of water or juice or tea and wait 15 min. If you still want a snack, have one. Often, you'll find that your body was saying \"drink\" and you heard \"eat\".\\n\\n4. Consider a healthier alternative. That's healthier - not low-fat. If you want strawberry ice cream, no amount of non-fat strawberry yogurt is going to help. But a rich, creamy Dannon Fruit-on-the-Bottom might just satisfy that craving. (or two- those cups are small) And since it provides the nutrients your body wants, it just may keep you from craving more, especially if you add some whole grain cereal on the top, or pair it with some whole-wheat toast or a granola bar.\n"

I do all sorts of sweet stuff for her, like take her out to movies, dinner, trips, etc.. I treat her like gold. So how can I show her I care about her feelings?\nAnswer: You mentioned many good things to not only impress a woman but to keep her satisfied materialistically. However, in my experience, when a woman says that you don't care about her feelings that usually means she feels that you don't listen to or try to help her with her problems or you don't ask for or respect her opinions. Both of these will require you to work on your listening skills. In the case of her problems she may only require someone to listen to her, if you have any advice, guidance or help to give then by all means give it. If not, then let her know that you will be there for her if she needs something from you. In the case of her opinions not only will you have to ask for them but also do what she wants to do, even when you don't want to.\\nGifts, trips, dates, these are all things that all women want, but they are far from ways that show that you care. Listening, offering your service, and respecting her opinion are but some of the ways to show a woman that you care about her feelings.\n"

Lemoore, California.  Lemoore has highest ratio of made 3 point shots in central section, Alex has highest ratio at Lemoore High School.  5'9\" 160lbs.  3.5gpa\nAnswer: Believe it or not, the coaches usually come to you -- early.  I know a 15-year-old, 6'3\" high school basketball star who started receiving letters from universities as a freshman.  This was before he was invited to join the varsity basketball team as a freshman.  In short, Big Ten university coaches have been courting him and his parents since he was 14.\\n\\nSince your star has not been approached at this point, you must take matter into your own hands.  Despite the height factor, treat your star like a product.  Become your own Arliss or Jerry Maguire, i.e., sports agent.  Look at the college sports pages for top twenty lists to map out your target schools.  Assemble a media kit with the newspaper clippings, high school transcripts, a personal essay, letters of recommendation from faculty and community leaders, and action photographs of your star.  Pitch your star to the head coach and assistant coaches.  If they require more information, offer to send them a media kit.  Request an interview.  If possible try to bring your star to meet the coach if his/her team is playing at a nearby university.  Send a thank you note.\\n\\nIf that does not work, network, network, network ... Cultivate relationships with the sports writers at your local and big city newspapers and the sports anchors of your local television networks.  Ask for help.  Then ask for recommendations.  For the most part, if your star is not on the front page of the sports section, then you must be aggressive in gaining coverage.  \\n\\nAdditional keys to boosting the profile of your star are park districts, regional tournaments, traveling teams, basketball festivals, and summer camps.  The more people know about the talents of your star, the better.  It may sound overwhelming (and expensive), but practice and multiple performance venues make perfect public relations for budding NCAA stars.  If your star has not been playing basketball year-round, since kintergarten, then expedite your media campaign -- yesterday.\\n\\nIf your star is really a star, then a scholarship is in your reach.  So, roll up your sleeves and claim it.  Ask the basketball coach, athletic director, principal and teachers for support in your endeavor because the universities will confirm your information.\\n\\nAgain, year-round participation is of vital importance.  So, research leagues outside of high school.\\n\\nHave a grateful day.\n"

        "sentence": "Question: why is the wealth of the world controlled by so few, while so many suffer and starve?\nAnswer: Well, the majority of your answers will probably have something to do with people being greedy or the rich having all the power or something like that.  While part of that is true, the other part of it is that no other system works.\\n\\nCommunism: the idea is great.  Everybody is equal, everybody has a job, everybody has the same income, etc.  Great idea, bad policy.  It doesn't work.  It's worked in a few countries, but over long periods of time, it always fails. Why?  Because there's no incentive to do well.  There's no incentive to get a better education, or to try to move up.  While the rich may seem to control a lot, and there may seem to be so much poverty, that's the best way for the world to run.  Seriously.  The poor have to work harder to move up.  The harder they work, the more they get paid, the more they can afford, etc.\\n\\nThat's the idea, anyway.  It doesn't always work, but it's a good start.  And where do the poor get their money from?  The rich.  And where do the rich get their products form?  The poor.  And where do we get hard workers who are dedicated?  From the incentive to advance through the ranks so that the poor can become the rich.\\n\\nPersonally, I tend to blame the poor more than anything for their situation.  See, I come from a low-income family.  I'm 20, and have found a way to get into college.  I've got  a 4.0 gpa, I hold a job, I spend time in the summer volunteering with children, and I coach baseball.  I do all of that while writing bad checks to pay the electric and phone bill.  So, what do I do to get by?  I work harder, I treat others right, and I've gained respect in the community.  What has that done for my family?  Well, you'd be surprised.  Now, I get treated well by people in the community, nobody looks down on me, and people offer to help me out.  Why?  Because I've spent my time helping others.  \\n\\nBasically, if the poor spent more time helping others, doing good deeds, working hard, helping the community, instead of committing crimes (the highest crime rate is among poor people), the community would have a better view of them, and might offer more help to them.  I'm not saying they would always, but in general, I think the situation for the poor would be better.\\n\\nThere's one other explanation that I'd like to share on why the poor seem to get poorer and the rich get richer.  The reason is minimum wage.  Let me expand a bit, so you can understand:\\n\\n\\n\\n1.When you raise minimum wage, there are two things that can happen.  When the minimum wage is raised, businesses are not going to profit as much, and smaller businesses especially will have to compensate.  To compensate, they either have to raise their prices or eliminate some employees.\\n\\nA.If you raise your prices, then the minimum wage increase is wiped out for those that got a pay raise.  Since only those making less than the new minimum wage would get an increase in pay, anyone making more than that would have to pay more for the same amount.  This means that the cost of living goes up, along with inflation.  This means that there will be more people living in poverty, the rich won’t be affected, and the middle-class will be even more strapped for cash.  Also note that the price increase will be felt throughout the factories making the product, the shipping companies, the storage companies, and the marketplace. The old adage “the rich get richer...” comes true again.\\n\\nB.If you eliminate employees, there are fewer jobs, which means that fewer people will have an income.  This will be felt in all areas of the workforce, as previously described, again meaning that the rich get richer. . . .  Inflation is still abound and the cost of living increases.  Now, since companies have a smaller workforce that is making more money, companies can do several things.\\n\\ni.Companies can now increase the costs of products since those at the bottom end are making more mo\n"

Slowest Gigahertz you should go with is about 1.5GHz.\\n\\nI would make sure that the notebook has at least 512MB of memory, preferably 1GB.  This is important if you run several programs at once (e-mail, internet, music player, and word processor).

Those women are thus (obviously??) likely to desire sex less than those men.\\n\\nIf women explore their sexuality, they can become multi - orgasmic, and can achieve massive prolonged orgasms, that might well exceed what men experience.  They might desire sex even more than the men involved.  I suspect that only a minority of women do this, however.\n"

And that's probably hard to believe since you two are so close. Men like kissing and fooling around with women and they don't really care who the woman is or about her feelings. Maybe he is lonely and hadn't been with a girl in a long time and you were just there so he decided to fool around with you with out considering your feelings. I'm sorry but he doesn't seem like a good friend. I'd try to find other friends and spend more time with them. It doesn't mean you have to ignore him completely. But he obviously doesn't care about your feelings and you should hang out with  other people who will. \\n\\nAnother possibility is that he might have been confused and wanted to kiss you to see if he might have had any feelings for you as more than a friend. Then he realized you two can only be friends. \\n\\nHowever, I think that the first might be more correct. He was not being respectful or considerate. Even if he wanted to try going out with you, he shouldn't have fingered you. He could have asked you out on a date but not go so far. I think he was just being plain selfish and took advantage of you. \\n\\nI would advise you to forget him and find another guy. But if you still want to try to get closer to him and get into a boy friend-girl friend  relationship, I would advise you to give him some time, but always treat him well, but don't really hint or talk about romance. Just show him you care by your actions. If after a while, it still didn't work, ask him out and say that you would really appreciate it if he could at least give you a chance. Tell him you think that you two would get a long great and that you want a chance because it's worth getting to know a girl who loves him so much. But don't let anything too intimate happen between you two on the first dates. He should respect that. Good luck! I hope everything works out for you!\n"

These thunderstorms often produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Tornadoes in the winter and early spring are often associated with strong, frontal systems that form in the Central States and move east. Occasionally, large outbreaks of tornadoes occur with this type of weather pattern. Several states may be affected by numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.\\n \\nDuring the spring in the Central Plains, thunderstorms frequently develop along a \"dryline,\" which separates very warm, moist air to the east from hot, dry air to the west. Tornado-producing thunderstorms may form as the dryline moves east during the afternoon hours. \\nAlong the front range of the Rocky Mountains, in the Texas panhandle, and in the southern High Plains, thunderstorms frequently form as air near the ground flows \"upslope\" toward higher terrain. If other favorable conditions exist, these thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\\n\\nTornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move over land.

The Bible speaks about sodomy, but always as a forced act or as part of a purely hedonistic culture.  Does this mean that God hates sodomy, or that he hates hedonism and rape?\\n\\nTo further question the teachings, one would begin to wonder, if God is all powerfull, and all-knowing (as in, he knows everything that was, everything that is, and everything that will be) and created everyone, why would he create some people knowing that they would do evil?\\n\\nFurther, why would God create these people, knowing that they would perform evil acts, and that he would have to punish them for all eternity in a torment beyond all possable comprehension?  If God loves us, why would he do this to us?\\n\\nWhat kind of God would tell us that he loves us, and then create us, with complete knowledge that our ultimate goal would be eternity in unimaginable horror?\\n\\nIf we start with the assumption that we have a Good and loving God, for no other kind of God is worth worship, then we must also assume that the Bible passages that tell of him punishing and tormenting us for our actions are flawed, either by misinterpretation of God's word, or to fullfill the purposes of whoever wrote those passages.\\n\\nThis will leave us with only one possable conclusion: that God does not truely hate or intend to punish people for things that they have no control over, or things that they are naturally predisposed to.  For, whether homosexuality is a choice or a fact of an individual's nature, it cannot be argued that the individual's personality is predisposed to homosexuality, for any choice comes from a natural inclination to make that particular choice.\\n\\nThis would leave most of our actions in God's hands, for God, as all knowing, knew every act we would perform in our entire lives before we are even born.  But a person must be held accountable for his actions, and some actions, such as murder, are clearly wrong.\\n\\nWhich brings us around to the possability that God is not all knowing and is as much in the dark about our actions as we are.  This would also open the door for homosexuality being a despised sin that God did not forsee occuring in an individual.\\n\\nPerhaps it's simply not possable to understand all the reasons and thoughts of God, or to truely get a grasp upon which of the Bible teachings are accurate to God's word and which are not.\\n\\nMaybe we can only do the best we can do, being the best person that we can be and hoping that our actions make God happy.\\n\\nThe best person that we can possably be is ourselves, to be somebody else is impossable.  I think that is all God really expects of us.\\n\\nFollow your heart when deciding what is sin and what is not.  And never judge somebody for their actions.  Only those who have never sinned or thought of sinning are worthy to judge.  Maybe some of us are wrong, maybe all of us are wrong, but we simply aren't in the position to decide that.\n"

If you attempt to engage first gear without completely stopping the car you will strip the first gear.  Believe me, I did.  It is a royal pain when driving slowly in traffic, people beep at you when you stop in slow moving traffic.  They have NO idea that I need to stop, they just think I can't drive.  Syncro requires the operator to Syncronize the speed with the gear.\\n\\n\\nA constant mesh transmission, on the other hand, can be shifted into any gear regardless of the cars speed.  Modern vehicles do not use syncromesh gear boxes any more, they were phased out in the sixties.\n"

There are many degrees.\\n\\nIf you are talking about animal rights, what rights should an animal be afforded?  Does an animal have the same rights as a human?

How exactly do you define cruelty?  Is dropping a kitten in boiling water cruel?  Most people would say yes.  How about dropping a mosquito larva in boiling water?  Or a lobster?  It's cruel to keep a kitten in a jar on your desk, but how about a goldfish?\\n\\nAs with most things in life, there is no easy answer.  Certainly, there should be some benefit, some gain to humanity that must be demonstrated in order to justify killing another organism, but what level of justification is required?  \\n\\nIs squirting caustic substances in a bunny's eyes justified if it means we can develop a substance that won't burn a child's eyes?  \\n\\nIs killing hundreds of thousands, even millions of mosquitoes justified if it keeps one person from dying from West Nile virus?  How about if it means you can have a backyard BBQ without being driven inside by biting flies?\\n\\nIs shooting a deer justified if it means that a family can eat for a month off the meat?  How about if some guy just really wants to kill something and put its head on his rec room wall?

Do Muslims believe in the virgin birth of Jesus?\\nFrom Huda,\\nYour Guide to Islam.\\nA.\\nMuslims believe that Jesus (called 'Isa in Arabic) was the son of Mary, and was conceived without the intervention of a human father. The Qur'an describes that an angel appeared to Mary, to announce to her the \"gift of a holy son\" (19:19). She was astonished at the news, and asked: \"How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?\" (19:20). When the angel explained to her that she had been chosen for the service of God, and that God had ordained the matter, she devoutly submitted herself to His will.\\n\\nIn the Qur'an and other Islamic sources, there is no mention of Joseph the carpenter, nor any recollection of the inn and manger legend. On the contrary, the Qur'an describes that Mary retreated from her people (outside the city), and gave birth to Jesus underneath a remote date palm tree.\\n\\n?If Jesus was born conceived by God, how could he not be the Son of God?\nAnswer: We Muslims believe the following things about Jesus:\\n\\n1. We love Jesus & respect him as a major prophet of Islam.\\n2. We also love the mother of Jesus, the Virgin Mary. We believe she was a pious and noble woman chosen over all of the women of the world. \\n3. Muslims believe that Jesus was born miraculously of a virgin mother and no father. His birth is miraculous like the birth of Adam, the first human being, who was created with neither mother nor father. \\n4. Muslims do not believe that Jesus was the son of God. God is so powerful and self-sufficient that He does not need a son or any kind of partner. \\n5. In Arabic Bible the name for God is Allah. Therefore all Arab Christian call God Allah as Muslim do as well. \\n6. Jesus did not die on the cross. Rather, God saved him as his enemies were confused about him. Jesus was taken up by God to Heaven. \\n7. Jesus is called Isa (pronounced Eesa) in Arabic. \\n8. Jesus performed miracles by the Will of God, like healing the blind and those with leprosy. \\n9. Jesus prayed to the same God as all Prophets and we Muslims pray to. \\n10. Jesus will return before the end of the world. \\n\\nIf Jesus is a son of God, then the following things come up:\\n\\n1. Why Adam & Eve are not sons & daughters of God when God created them without parents?\\n2. What about all living beings which God created without both father & mother for the first time?\\n3. If Jesus was son of God, then why only 120 people accepted his prophethood at that time, rest of all spit on him, insulted him, terrorized him and eventually killed him (Christian belief) but God didn't save him?\\n4. If we take Jesus born without 'father' then how come God is his father?\\n5. As God is all powerful & compared to no one then how come he beget a son like humans?\\n6. God doesn't need any food nor any shelter. But why Jesus felt hungry and sought rest & comfort?\\n7. No one can do any harm to God, but how come people murdered Jesus?\\n8. God has no beginning & no end, how come Jesus was born & eventually died?\\n\\nYou do not have to answer these. There is no direct statement by Jesus himself that he came to fulfill this mission. He was very clear to tell people that God is my God and yours. He used to pray to God and ask Him for support and comfort.

That the earth is but a minute object in the Cosmos; that it forms one of a number of bodies, many of them larger than itself, revolving around their central luminary, the sun; that there exist in the realms of space myriads of similar suns, centres themselves of other solar systems; that millions of planets, which we cannot see, are inhabited with races of intelligent beings -- these are facts of which almost everybody must cognisant, but on which few bestow much time or thought.\\n\\nAstronomy teaches that, just as our solar system had a beginning, so it must have an end, and that, as at one time life was impossible upon the earth, so there will come a time when man will no longer be able to exist.\\n\\nScience, cold and calculating, has foretold the physical end of the world -- has prophesied the destruction of the globe and all its contents.\\n\\nBirth, life, death -- it has been well been said --appear to be the rule of the universe at large, as well as in our own little corner of it. Suns and planets are evolved, they flourish, and at length decay; and new suns and systems will arise to take their places.\\n\\nThe \"End of the World\" may be taken in two different senses, as meaning either the annihilation of our planet by sudden catastrophe, or by gradual decay, or else the disappearance of human life from the face of the globe, owing to some state of circumstances, possible, at any rate, if not probable.\\n\\nIt is our purpose in this article briefly to consider some of the opinions held by men of learning and repute regarding the end of the world, and to emphasise the lesson taught by Nature that the individual counts for nothing in the history of the race, the race for nothing in the life of the planet, and the planet for nothing in the duration of the Universe.\\n\\nVery many derive their inspiration on this absorbing subject from the Bible, where we read: \"The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heal, the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned up.\"\\n\\nEvery child knows that water was the agency of destruction in the ancient world, and that the rainbow was placed in the sky as a token that life should never be destroyed by this cause again. All through the Bible we may trace the prophecy that the world would come to an end by being consumed with fire.\\n\\nIt is out of our province here to touch on the signs given in the Bible whereby the arrival of the last day may be predicted. Certain preachers have brought great ridicule on themselves by their very certain statements on this point, but they seem little abashed when their prophecies do not come true, and merely alter dates and times to suit the next occasion.\\n\\nMany readers will call to mind a rhyme which at the time terrorised the minds of hundreds of thousands of young and ignorant people --\\n\\n\"The world unto an end shall come\\nIn Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-One.\"\\nThe date has been often changed and will (it may safely be said) continue to be changed for the benefit of future generations. It is curious to notice that hardly two philosophers agree as to the manner in which the end of the world may be expected to arrive. Some put their faith in a celestial catastrophe so terrible as literally to wipe our earth out of existence, while others prefer to believe that though man may no longer be able to exist, the world will still continue its appointed motions.\\nLord Kelvin startled us not long ago by affirming that there was only oxygen in the atmosphere sufficient to last mankind for some 300 years, and that the world was doomed to die of suffocation.

Now personally, I'm sure we're not as complicated as what I thinks most likely is out in space, but I find it hard to reason how we developed from a single cell life form.  Anyone have a chart of life's path from that to us...which would make some sense out of this?\\n\\nI'm not saying there is or isnt' a god or that someone planted us here, but the conventional explanation of evolution is just not clear in my head.  Could someone demonstrate a timeline that makes sense of earth's inhabitance from it's creation?\nAnswer: Your question is a very reasonable one --and brave, since you'll certainly get answers from religious zealots who have completely closed their minds.  Let me start by saying my *only* personal agenda is a search for the truth, no matter where it leads me.  Unlike many, I'm not here to shove my beliefs down anyone's throat. \\n\\nThe short answer is that I doubt it's possible in this kind of forum to get into enough details to convince a confirmed *creationist* that humans evolved from simpler life forms.  But I hope to encourage an open-minded person to continue with their own research, and not be tempted by overly \"easy\" answers.   \\n\\nThe long answer (most of it written by me, some of it transcribed manually; none of it pasted)...\\n\\nI, too, was unclear about the evolutionary process for a long time.  While I'm not an expert (and *nobody* has *all* the answers) I think I can help you get to a place where it makes *sense* to you as it now does to me, since you appear to have an open mind.  (Agnosticism is good!)  \\n\\nAfter hearing people's arguments and questions for many years, I am convinced that there are six huge factors getting in the way of a general acceptance of the *overwhelming* scientific evidence for evolution.  \\n\\n1 - the common misconception that evolution claims apes or chimpanzees changed to human beings, and the perceived indignity -- and indignation -- that goes along with that idea... or with *any* suggestion that we evolved from a lower form.  It's nothing but ridiculous human arrogance!\\n2 - the lack of human conception for the vast time life has had on Earth to evolve\\n3 - the human temptation to rush things and jump to ridiculous (and therefore naturally hard to believe) conclusions.  Evolution involves not three or four steps, like fish to amphibian to ape to human!)... not hundreds, or even thousands of big, visible steps... but perhaps hundreds of millions of minute, subtle changes in a life form.  Remember, we have had the time!\\n4 - the mistaken notion that creatures evolved because they \"decided\" to, or \"wanted\" to.  When we say, for example, that fish needed to absorb oxygen more efficiently from the water, so they evolved gills, that's not to imply it was a choice.  Evolution is about mutations... changes that were random from one generation to the next, over long periods of time.  Those changes that happened to be good for the creature meant that creature survived long enough to reproduce, which meant there would now be lots of little babies with that same feature.\\n5 - a fearful and/or stubborn refusal to abandon faith in a Creator, since doing so might condemn the unbeliever to eternal suffering\\n6 - It's just *easier* to think about a Creator.\\n\\nI know you want to see some details of our \"life's path\" to make sense of it, and I will provide that, below.  Just a bit more, first.\\n\\nThe central ideas of evolution are that all life shares a common ancestor, and that it has changed over time (obviously, if we are to explain getting from A to B).  While it's hard for many people to imagine the changes that would result in, for example, human beings from lifelessness, the first thing to keep firmly in mind is that we are talking about an *unimagineable* amount of time to play with... the earth having been around for some 4.5 billion years, as you said.\\n\\nUnderstandably, few people can appreciate how much a billion is.  Do you realize that roughly a billion *seconds* ago, \"The Godfather, Part 2\" was about to win the Academy Award for Best Picture?... that Richard Nixon was President of the U.S.?... that Hank Aaron had just broken Babe Ruth's record of 714 career home runs?  1974 was drawing to a close -- one billion seconds ago.\\n\\nIt's a lack of appreciation for this vast amount of time which, I think, makes people skeptical.
