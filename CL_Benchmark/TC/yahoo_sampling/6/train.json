However, if the majority of any religions adherents practice a religion in a particular way, then THAT is what the religion is, regardless of what a minority say or what a verse here or there says.  Can anybody tell me which Muslim countries are tolerant, loving and peaceful toward other religions including Jews and Christians?\nAnswer: Dont take it by countries , because in the midevals , europe was more entolerant than the most islamic extremists of nowadays \\n e.g: was the crusadors invade palastine for the first time and entered jerusalem for the first time ( the city of peace ) they , by the name of GOD , killed every one alife in the city , even when civilians sheltered in the great musque , crusadors made that musque a lovely big blood bath , where they killed every one alife , years later Saladin entered the same city without killing a soul after it surrendered , and christians lived there after that in peace \\n\\ne.g 2 : when muslems invade spain , they last there for 800 years , and the christians still live there in peace as christians , nobody was forced to change his religon , but later when qween Ezabella and her huspand took back spain , they evacuate it from every muslim in less that 30 years ( of course by tortue and descrimination - having a koran at home was a crime could be sentenced to death penalty at that time)\\n\\ndoes that mean that christianity is a violent religion ? and islam is a peaceful one ? of course not ! so what does that mean ?\\n\\nthat means that the whole thing is a matter of civilizations , the more civilized nations , the more tolerant ones .... \\n\\nnow lets go to the modern days , the west , and now the far east too , is at it's peak of civilization , so it can be tolerant with anything , the muslim world is at it's worst days and laying in the bottom of civilization , that's why many of them cant think descent ... they are to blame others about what they are now , and as for there is no hope for being better , an individual violent terrorist efforts came up to face the world , to say we are the solution , and islam is what we stand for , and it ordered us to do so ...\\n\\nabout countries , countries still tolerant , for example , in Egypt , my country , the biggest billionaire is christian , and the other big ones many of them are christians .... christians work in everything as judges , oficers , minister of commerce is christian, i have christian friends ... etc.\\n\\nBUT , dont take countries as something to see islam from , because it's a matter of periods , that is the period where muslims are at the bottom , so dont excpect much from them , when christians were not so civilized , i told you what they did .... and new thing , when americans got black ppl from africa , where was there tolerance , those blacks had religions at that time , no body respect those religions , some of them were muslims , but they all were forced to convert ( again: does it mean that christianity is bad because what it's countries or followers do , no , but it was a matter of civilization )\\n\\nso dont blame islam for what the muslims at that time do , they are at the bottom now , that's all\\n\\nfor any comment feel fry to write at amgad_he@yahoo.com\\n\\ni hope that helps\n"

Most of the clubs do their recruiting either at the beginning or the end of the semester. See if there are any clubs that are doing anything that you might remotely be interested in. If you know someone who's in a club, asking about the club's activities might be a way to start a friendly conversation. \\n\\nThere are also the usual extra-curricular activities and sports available. When I went off to school, I joined the band and enjoyed it...I got good at it, and ended up going to college for free on music scholarships, so getting involved in an activity can actually be beneficial in more ways than you initially realize. \\n\\nIf there are any opportunities to volunteer around the school, do so. I still use this tactic from time to time when I'm in a new situation and need to meet people. While doing the volunteer activity, you can make small talk with whoever's standing next to you, even if it's something goofy like, \"Hey, I like that shirt you're wearing.\" (However, clothing compliments can only go so far if you're at a school that uses uniforms). \\n\\nThe only real answer is to get involved. Even if you're shy at first, you must get involved. If all else fails, just admit to a teacher that you're having a bit of a hard time adjusting socially. They'll usually be glad to help you hook up with some kind of activity.\n"

You can also see where your teammates are, who might be open, and what a good passing opportunity might be.\\n\\nThis is a great drill for getting used to dribbling with your head up so you can see the floor: simply start at one baseline and dribble full speed the full length of the court, keeping your head up at all times. DO NOT look down at the ball. Switch hands at half court. You can also try this drill with your eyes closed. But only dribble at half speed, and make sure to open your eyes after a few dribbles to make sure you aren't going to run into anything.\\n\\n\\nBe able to dribble with either hand\\nIf you can only dribble effectively with your strong hand, you are very limited as an offensive threat. If I'm a defender, and I know you can only dribble to your right side, it will be very easy to guard you. But if you can drive to either your right or left, and have a good outside shot, then you're a real threat. Then I have to guard against a shot, and a drive to either side. Now you've got me guessing about what you might do next. Work on dribbling with both hands so that you don't have a weak dribbling hand. Work at it enough that you can dribble and drive to the baset equally well with either hand.\\n\\nThere are two ways to build your off-hand dribbling skills: one is simply to practice with your off hand. Make a point to do ONLY off hand dribbling drills for 15 or 20 mins a day for the next week. You'll be amazed at how much better your off hand will be in just that short amount of time.\\n\\nAnother amazing set of drills for developing your off hand are two-ball drills. Get two basketballs and start off at the baseline. Dribble both balls in a zig-zag pattern for the full length of the court, bouncing the balls at the same time. Once you reach the other end of the floor, do the same drill, but this time bounce the balls at different times (one ball hits the ground as the other ball comes up to your other hand, etc.). Remember, don't look down at the balls as you dribble. Do these drills for a few weeks and your off hand dribbling ability will be much improved.\\n\\n\\nBALL SLAP DRILL \\nThe ball slap drill is performed by taking the ball and with your left hand slap the ball hard, and then taking your right hand and slap the ball hard. This ball slap drill is a good way to warm your hands up and this will help you get a good feel for the ball. Continue performing the slap the ball dribbling drill until your hands are good, awake, and ready to begin. \\n\\n\\nAROUND THE WORLD DRILL \\nBasketball Dribbling Drill #2: The around the world basketball drill stats by circling the ball around your head, than your waist, and finally put your legs together and take the ball around both legs at the knees. Then, bend at the waist, spread your legs, and circle the ball around one leg, then the other. The around the world basketball drill will give you a great feel for the ball in addition to hand coordination and\n"

        "sentence": "Title: Does it follow: If abortion is illegal, government can come into our bedroom or force us to get pregnant?\nQuestion: Consider: Governments, such as in China, currently force women to have abortions, become sterilized, or contracept. They allow only ONE CHILD per family! Abortion is not only legal there but dictated by population control groups and government officials who accept this ideology. If a \"woman's right to choose\" to kill her child is withdrawn how does this give any government the authority or power to tell you \"when or if you should get pregnant?\" It seems to me that \"the government came into our bedroom\" when nine Supreme Court judges (men!) ruled on the abortion issue in 1973. Prior to that WE were voting on whether we wanted abortion legal in each state. Our government ENDED that vote! Furthermore, I suggest that sexuality is not a \"private\" matter in the first place because it involves not only the TWO persons who copulate, but the whole family who cares about and supports them (as well as friends, church, etc.). In Hilary Clinton's infamous words \"it takes a village to raise a child.\" Another factor is that abortion is about ending a life (even if you don't consider that life a person) and \"the bedroom\" concerns beginning a life, the latter of which no one has proposed need be regulated... EXCEPT anti-population advocates who also support abortion! So isn't the real issue not what governments will do in our bedrooms but should they protect all human life or not? Do we allow any other type of murder in our bedrooms? Instead we should also ask ourselves, why not make it legal to kill our post-born children when we allow our pre-born to be killed? Shouldn't we be consistent in our arguments? I suspect a prolife government is better than an anti-life government just as surely as a prolife doctor is better than one who deals death. Right?\nAnswer: NO, not right.  Your question is conveluted and misses the point completely.  I can't even respond becuase your conclusions come from no real reasoning.  The tall and skinny of it is this: our governement is not anti-life.  It is pretty clearly pro-life, and anti-abortion.  Consider the fact that there is currently a third trimester partial birth abortion ban.  This is the only kind of abortion that the Supreme Court has said would be acceptable to ban completely.  And the FEDERAL government did this.  It is not a people or a state issue.  It is no business of the government's what I do with my uterus - I would never presume to tell you or Ms. Rice what to do with yours, so stay the hell away from mine.  The fact is abortion is not a form of murder (argue it all you want, I am talking legally) , so your argument that we can't comitt murder in our bedroom blah blah really doesn't follow.  This is a privacy issue - the Supreme Court has held that our Constitution protects privacy interests in our own homes in many many different ways.  I suggest you consider the fact that this posting board ONLY exists becuase the Constition provides a free speech protection.  The government cannot come in and tell you not to express your opinion (thought the Bush White House apparently feels this doesn't apply to them...).  Get off your crazy high horse, your argument is so off and so full of misunderstings its not even funny.\n"

How did all populations of humans advance at the same time?\nQuestion: For approximately 150-200,000 years, humans essentially lived like very smart animals, then fairly suddenly, about 10,000 years ago, we all seemed to have discovered agriculture and \"civilization\"..a few thousand years later we were all writing.  I have never seen a decent, logical explanation for how all the populations of the Earth took this \"great leap forward\" at the same time-After 150-200,000 years, suddenly within about 1% of that time frame, there are cities everywhere from the Middle East, to China, to North and South America?  Writing starting independently everywhere?  For me, this is the most mysterious event in all of history-any ideas?\nAnswer: Hey! Your \"other\" question is already cluttered up with some high voltage discussion and nice arguements so, I thought I should post my answer here as it is more peaceful and calm here. I was wondering whether I should have posted my answer there? \\n\\nNow, I'll try to make sense while talking about a topic that I know little about. \\n\\n1- It all started with the arrival of the first bipedal- Australopithecus anamensis. (some might argue that it was Ardipithecus ramidus). Ok, the point is, as our ancestors started to learn to walk on two feet, they had some challenges to face as bipedalism reduced their speed considerably putting them at a clear disadvantage against their predators.\\nNow, as this problem was faced by all the hominids all over the world at the same time, it led to some parallel thoughts (and thus inventions and discoveries) all over the world e.g. building homes, making weapons and tools etc. (The stone tools were first made by the handy man i.e. Homo habilis and not Australopithecus).\\nThis tool technology was spread by Homo ergaster as they  migrated outside Africa.\\n\\n2- Then, in the course of evolution, the early humans started to have a complex cultural lives and they grew emotionally, e.g. the Neanderthals (who aren't our direct ancestors) started to bury the dead.\\n\\n3- As the homo species like homo erectus, homo neanderthalis, homo heidelbergenesis and ancient homo sapiens (Cro Magnon) made further advances in creativity and productivity, they all felt a natural need to pen down their thoughts. This led to the cave painitngs and carvings. All of those paintings can be interpreted as diary entries as you may see that the paintings and carvings simply depict what the early men \"did\" i.e. hunting, using tools etc.\\nSo, I guess it is understandable why the \"pictorial-scripts\" developed contemporarily to each other.\\n\\n4- But the question still remains: Why were the origin of world's ancient scripts so contemporary to each other? I guess, as man found the pictorial depiction of thoughts and emotions more and more unconvenient and tedious due to the diverseness of thoughts and situations to be depicted, it started taking help of symbols. Perhaps, this behaviour was so \"human-like\" that every sub-species of the homo sapiens followed this pattern of 'depicting thoughts symbolically' universally.\\n\\n5- Another reason of this might be migration. Before the ancient civilizations like Inka, Mesopotamia, Egyptian etc. even came into existence, the early hominids led a nomadic life. According to the \"Out of Africa Hypothesis\", all the modern humans \"Homo Sapiens\" originated from Africa. Later, they migrated to Africa, Asia and Europe and formed groups.\\nSo, I guess due to their similar ancestral origins, the human beings had a common problem solving approach and hence, attempted the problem of inconvenience of pictorial scripts in a nearly identical manner.\\n\\nThe scientific difference in the scripts can explain that they were devised on completely different grounds but, the approach was similar due to common origins and creative grounds.\n"

Having many people love you seems a bit selfish and never loving anyone shouldn't be an option. One way you can find a happy medium with this is to actually love people; and this doesn't mean having sex either because love and sex are two different things. If you love people you won't have to scale from people loving you to never loving anyone. But your question seems like you're saying that people should give you love or else you're not gonna give it. It shouldn't be like that because then it wasn't love to began with.\n"

Vicente Fox must be sitting back laughing his butt off over this situation.  Think about it...by encouraging illegal immigration, he has been able to solve one of Mexico's greatest problems; a burgeoning underclass of people who cannot find work.  He exports these people, eliminating a burden on his own weakened government, and in that same token, profits from those who have left as they work here in the US and send money back into the Mexican economy (some figures show that as much as $40B a year goes from illegals back into Mexico).  From Fox's perspective, this is a win-win...he gets rid of undesirables and benefits monetarily from their illegal exodus into the US without having to do anything on his own.  The biggest thing he has to do is maintain a façade of indignation over the treatment of people he doesn’t give a crap about to begin with.  We need to view this as what it really is…it is an invasion.  Or worse yet, a colonization of the South West under the approval of the Mexican government.\n"

The particular bacteria might be resistant to whatever antibiotics they gave you.  You would need a culture of your snot to determine this.\\n\\nUltimately though, the problem probably started with poor sinus drainage.  Even with appropriate antibiotics, the problem will recur if the sinus drainage issue isn't resolved.  In the short term, Sudafed would probably help.  I don't like the idea of using Sudafed for more than a couple of weeks though.  If you have allergies exacerbating the situation (do you have a history of seasonal allergies, or any new pets?), then Benadryl or non-sedating Claritin would help.  For really bad cases, I know of a doctor that swears by the Neti pot (he uses it himself).  It's like a little watering pot for plants.  You fill it up with water or saline and pour it into your nose.  Basically you're physically cleaning out your sinus openings.\\n\\nIf there is a possibility you're allergic to something, I would try Claritin and the Neti pot first for 3 days and see if the symptoms improve.  If you don't think it's an allergy, try Sudafed + Neti pot.  If that doesn't do it, I would go back to the doctor and try another antibiotic together with the Sudafed + Neti pot.  VERY IMPORTANT: IF THE INFECTION SPREADS--YOUR CHEEK BECOMES RED AND PAINFUL OR IT HURTS TO MOVE AN EYE--GO STRAIGHT TO THE ER.  Sinusitis is normally just an inconvenience, not a serious health problem.  It can sometimes spread, however, and cause cellulitis in your cheek or an orbital abscess in your eye socket--both very serious conditions.\n"

One chlamydia infection may not have caused that but it isn't impossible. Other things that can cause lower abdominal pain are cysts, fibroids, endometriosis, etc. You can observe and chart the pain you have and when in your monthly menstrual cycle. If you have it again you need to see a doctor. Mid cycle pain can be ovulation pain which isn't anything to worry about. \\n\\nHope it is only a one time temporary thing, but if it continues you do need to seek medical advice so that you treat it early.\n"

You can use the information below as a reference to guide yourself and figure out how long derogatory information stays on your credit report\\n\\nGeneral credit information: 7yrs\\nCollections: 7yrs from date of last activity\\nBankruptcy: 10 yrs\\nForeclosure: 12 yrs from the date filed\\nGarnishment: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\\nJudgment: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\\nTax lien: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\\nDismissed garnishments, judgments, and tax liens: not reportable\\n\\nNow that you have this information I’ll give you an example similar to a client. The agent he had worked with before gave him the wrong advice.\\n\\nLets assume that you had a collection for $1,000 filed against you in December 1998 and you haven’t paid it. It’s now November 2005, so in a few weeks that collection can come off your credit report. (You will probably have to request all three credit bureaus to take it off your credit report). However, you just applied for a loan today and the loan officer tells you that you need to payoff that debt in order to be approved. Since you have the money to pay it off, you do so. Because the date of last activity is now November 2005, the collection will show on your report until November 2012 – another additional 7 years.\\n\\nNow let assume that this collection was in June 2005 and you pay it off in November 2005 to obtain the loan, this will reduce your credit score. On the other hand if this collection was in September 2005 and you pay it off in November 2005 to obtain the loan, this will actually increase your score. My point is that a collection account that is less than 6 months old and is paid off will be beneficial but if your collection account is more than 6 months old and is paid off this will be detrimental to your credit score.\\n\\nYou as a consumer can request copies of your credit report from the 3 credit bureaus (although it’s better to get a collective report from all three in one which I can help you with) and dispute information that is incorrect. Incorrect information can be corrected or removed but correct information (good or bad) usually stays on the report for the period allowed. Only the credit grantor (lender/bank) or credit bureau can remove correct information.\\n\\nIf you find incorrect information on your report, contact the credit grantor obtain an explanation, have them corrected and ask them to contact all three credit bureaus and correct that information on your report. After this you should also contact all three credit with a letter with documented proof of the error on your report and ask them to remove this information. The credit bureaus by law have to respond to your letter and request. Depending on your case they might approve or deny your request but they have to respond to your letter. Following are the addresses for all three credit bureaus.\\n\\nTrans Union\\nPO Box 4000\\nChester, PA 19022\\n866-887-2673\\nhttp://www.transunion.com/\\n\\nExperian\\nPO Box 2002\\nAllen, TX 75013\\n888-397-3742\\nhttp://www.experian.com/\\n\\nEquifax Credit\\nPO Box 740241\\nAtlanta, GA 30374\\n800-685-1111\\nhttp://www.equifax.com/\n"
