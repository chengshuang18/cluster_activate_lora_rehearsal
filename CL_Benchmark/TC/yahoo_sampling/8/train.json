Some help a lot, i have proof of that, and I don't take the ones that are dangeorous.\nAnswer: NV does work for weight loss.  To get maximum effect you still need to eat healthy and exercise.  There are some stimulants in NV and if take one bottle and don't like it you are not out much.  Also, the main ingredient for weight loss is Hoodia which is an all natural appetite suppressant from South Africa.\n"

The best way to try to prevent it is by washing frequently or using hand sanitizer. \\n\\nBefore I start work everyday, I sanitize my keyboard, and my telephone in case someone before me was using it and  you know, knock on wood, I have not been sick this year. Maybe a slight cold, but not the flu. \\n\\nMind you, you may not be fortunate enough to escape it, but keeping your hands and property clean are great precautious measures. Check this info out and go to the website as well ;)\\n\\nWhat Is the Flu?\\nFlu is the common name for influenza (pronounced: in-floo-en-za), a virus that attacks the respiratory system.\\n\\nThere are three different types of the flu virus. Types A and B can cause widespread flu outbreaks (although type B usually causes less severe symptoms than type A). Type C is fairly rare and causes only mild symptoms.\\n\\nUsually when you're sick with a virus, your body builds up a defense system by making antibodies against it, so you don't get that particular virus strain again. Unfortunately, flu viruses mutate (change) each year, so you aren't protected from the disease forever. Some years the change in the flu virus is slight, so even if you get the flu it's a mild case because the antibodies give you partial protection. But every 10 years or so the flu virus undergoes a major change, and many people get severe cases. These large-scale outbreaks are called epidemics. If they spread worldwide, they're called pandemics.\n"

It is caused by an allergic reaction to gluten/gliadin proteins in wheat, rye and barley.  \\n\\nThe only treatment is nutritional - avoidance of the foods that contain the proteins.  Medical doctors may miss this common condition (often misdiagnosed as IBS) because it is a nutritional problem and there is no drug treatment.

I bought her a nice traditional garnet/gold ring in Prague for her birthday and figured that was better than buying her a nice outfit. I am debating about whether to do a shopping spree for her here and just give her the things when I get back, or saving my money now and just taking her out for a surprise date in which I'd take her out for a really nice date and pay for a manicure/pedicure and possibly the perm she wants, take her to the scrapbook store to buy some new things (she loves that), and possibly buy her a really nice set of hair care products too. Do you think that is all better than trying to buy her some random clothes here? I may still get her some lingerie here, but I could buy her a few outfits but then I'd spend all my money here.\nAnswer: Don't spend \"all\" your money, but do buy her some presents while you are away.  It shows that you were thinking of her all the time you were apart, and if you wait until you get back home, it will look like you are making a lame effort to catch up.

If we want an actual appraisal, do we have to purchase that separately?  We're paying for the appraisal ourselves & would really like to know the true appraised value of the home we're buying.\nAnswer: Because normally the appraiser feels it is his job only to justify the price that the house is selling for.  Remember the appraiser is ultimately there to protect the bank that is loaning you the money for the home.  If you default they want to know that they will be able to recoup their costs.\\n\\nIf the appraiser said that the house was worth 50,000 more than you are paying for it are you going to now pay the seller 50,000 more?  If the appraiser says it is worth less than you are paying for it, then the bank is going to make you pay cash for the difference, the bank won't give you a mortgage for more than the appraisal.\\n\\nThere is no incentive for the appraiser to come in with a high appraisal.

Can anybody tell me which Muslim countries are tolerant, loving and peaceful toward other religions including Jews and Christians?\nAnswer: Dont take it by countries , because in the midevals , europe was more entolerant than the most islamic extremists of nowadays \\n e.g: was the crusadors invade palastine for the first time and entered jerusalem for the first time ( the city of peace ) they , by the name of GOD , killed every one alife in the city , even when civilians sheltered in the great musque , crusadors made that musque a lovely big blood bath , where they killed every one alife , years later Saladin entered the same city without killing a soul after it surrendered , and christians lived there after that in peace \\n\\ne.g 2 : when muslems invade spain , they last there for 800 years , and the christians still live there in peace as christians , nobody was forced to change his religon , but later when qween Ezabella and her huspand took back spain , they evacuate it from every muslim in less that 30 years ( of course by tortue and descrimination - having a koran at home was a crime could be sentenced to death penalty at that time)\\n\\ndoes that mean that christianity is a violent religion ? and islam is a peaceful one ? of course not ! so what does that mean ?\\n\\nthat means that the whole thing is a matter of civilizations , the more civilized nations , the more tolerant ones .... \\n\\nnow lets go to the modern days , the west , and now the far east too , is at it's peak of civilization , so it can be tolerant with anything , the muslim world is at it's worst days and laying in the bottom of civilization , that's why many of them cant think descent ... they are to blame others about what they are now , and as for there is no hope for being better , an individual violent terrorist efforts came up to face the world , to say we are the solution , and islam is what we stand for , and it ordered us to do so ...\\n\\nabout countries , countries still tolerant , for example , in Egypt , my country , the biggest billionaire is christian , and the other big ones many of them are christians .... christians work in everything as judges , oficers , minister of commerce is christian, i have christian friends ... etc.\\n\\nBUT , dont take countries as something to see islam from , because it's a matter of periods , that is the period where muslims are at the bottom , so dont excpect much from them , when christians were not so civilized , i told you what they did .... and new thing , when americans got black ppl from africa , where was there tolerance , those blacks had religions at that time , no body respect those religions , some of them were muslims , but they all were forced to convert ( again: does it mean that christianity is bad because what it's countries or followers do , no , but it was a matter of civilization )\\n\\nso dont blame islam for what the muslims at that time do , they are at the bottom now , that's all\\n\\nfor any comment feel fry to write at amgad_he@yahoo.com\\n\\ni hope that helps\n"

That being said, children learn best through play. A child builds mathmatical concepts at a very early age, though they do not know it as \"math.\" You may not even recognize it as math. \\n\\nAs a child plays with blocks, they are building geometric concepts about shapes and spatial reasoning. They may not even be able to name the shapes, but as they try to build a tower with the blocks, they are using problem solving skills to keep the tower from falling. \\n\\nProblem solving also comes into play with such simple activities as hide and seek or memory/matching games. With a memory game, a child learns to think about the tiles they have turned over already, realizing which ones might match. Also, when a child presents a problem to you through play activity, like \"I can't do it. How can I...?\" Don't just answer it for them. Problem solve with them. Problem solving abilities will be critical for them throughout school.\\n\\nReasoning skills are another mathematical concept. These are easily practiced through games and sorting acitvities. Promote this skill by asking questions like:\\nAre you sure?\\nHow do you know?\\nWhy do you think...?\\n\\nFoster communication skills. Children must be able to clearly communicate their thoughts in order to explain their steps in solving problems or in trying to understand new concepts. Reading to children is the single most important activity you can do as a parent. Reading skills will help a child in every subject area.\\n\\nI could go on and on.

And Sting (the famous singer) has bragged about being able to go on all night- literally- without a climax.  There's huge variance.\\n\\nOptimally, a good amount of time is about fifteen to twenty minutes of actual thrusting; with the overall lovemaking experience going from forty five minutes to an hour, if not longer.\\n\\nIf you can't, there's nothing wrong- you can get better with time.  Just practice controlling yourself (try thinking of non-sexy things when you get close- like grandma on the toilet, lol- and masturbate beforehand so you aren't so close and on the edge going into things.  And let your partner know what's going on- when you get close, stop, take a breather on yourself, and focus on her/him, then go back to spending some time on you or together, and so on, give and take, until you are both breathlessly ready for climax.  It's a thing that both of you can deal with.\\n\\nIf you still climax too soon, just remember that sex isn't over!  Your partner deserves to climax, too.  Keep a spare dildo in the drawer next to the bed, or even a strap-on (quite a few men wear strap-on dildos over their flaccid penises) to keep things going once you go soft, or just rely on your hands, mouth, and fingers to get help him/her out!\\n\\nRemember not to stress overmuch, and good luck!\n"

A = 4, B = 7\nAnswer: Partial fraction decomposition is simply the undoing of the process of adding two unlike fractions. For example, one would add 1/3 to 2/5 by saying 1/3 + 2/5 = 5/(5*3) + (3*2)/(5*3) = [5 + (3*2)] / (5*3) = 11/15.\\nPartial fraction decomposition is noting that in the fraction 11/15, the denominator is the product 5*3 and finding the numbers A and B such that 11/15 = A/3 + B/5. From the above, we know that A = 1 and B = 2. \\nIn the case of a variable denominator that is a polynomial, we know from algebra that all polynomials can be factored (over the real numbers) into a product of monomials, binomials, and quadratics. These forms are convenient because they yield easy integrations (if you're not up to calculus yet).\\nIn your case, we have (11x - 2)/(x^2 + x - 6) = (11x - 2)/[(x + 3)*(x - 2)].\\nWe thus want to find A and B such that we can write this fraction in the simpler form (for integration) A/(x + 3) + B/(x - 2).\\nTo find A and B, we evaluate the sum above to get [A(x - 2) + B(x + 3)]/[(x + 3)(x - 2)]. Since the numerator must be 11x - 2, we have Ax - 2A + Bx + 3B = 11x - 2. \\nGrouping like terms, we get (A + B)x + (3B - 2A) = 11x + (-2).\\nThus, A + B = 11 and 3B - 2A = -2. Solving the first equation for A, we get A = 11 - B. Plugging this value of A into the second equation gives us 3B - 2(11 - B) = -2. Solving for B, we get B = 4. Thus, A = 11 - 4 = 7.\\nOnce you get used to this, you will find that it is a lot quicker than manually plugging in all 4 multiple choice values.\n"

I'm not sure I understand why it takes so much effort and emotional exchange to take place before having a sexual experience with another human being. What's the big deal. Okay, disease is your concern. So why not put more effort into prevention and finding cures for them? That's solved. So now.. what stops everyone from just having sex for fun. I don't get it. Besides the fact of say family relations.. that would be gross. But strangers should be with out question, perfect game for just going at it with each other. They should set up centers for people to meet and have sex for free with each other. Is it women who stop this from occurring? Is it the attachment and bonding of the emotion love? What is it? Why can't we relieve our tension with sex the same way we would with a nice massage by a stranger? Were the 60's the only time to do this? What happened to the passion?\nAnswer: Well, you put alot of thought into your question.  The 60's ended December 31, 1969.  Unless you've got a time machine, the 60's can't help you.  Most VD could be cured by antbiotics.  AIDS changed all that.  So, yes the 60's (and most of the 70's and some of the 80's and when you think about it the 90's too and then there was last week....) was the only time to do this.  And the last time I checked, massages did not spead disease.\\n\\nAnd you don't sound like someone who's actually HAD a disease or you wouldn't have glossed over it so easily.  You also sound like someone who hasn't had a bad experience with one night stands.  The rejection that occurs from getting attached to someone who wants nothing further to do with you can be devastating.  Add to that the poossiblity that your pick-up could be a killer psycho, and sex with strangers loses some of its appeal.  \\n\\nHey, women want good sex just as much as men, but let's face it, most men are pretty easy to please.  All a woman has to do is show up and men are happy.  Men need a few times to \"get it right\" and so need to offer something more than just sex.  Witty conversation and manners, for example.  If a woman is bolting out of bed after sex, then something's wrong. \\n\\nAnd society encourages promiscuity, so no blame there either.  Even have a song about it.\\n\\nWhy limit yourself to strangers exclusively, though?  I find that most intruiging.  It seems you only find strangers appealing.  You could get much more sex in a monogamous situation, so I wonder why that route wasn't even considered in your question.  No diseases, no brutal murders, and mutual satsfaction.....and passion.  \\n\\nI understand the appeal of the one night stand; the mystery, the unpredictability, the variety.  But in the cold hard light of day, you know they're just not someone you'd like to hang with.  And once again comes the lonliness, the emptiness and the boredom.\\n\\nLet's face it...sex with strangers is common, the status quo...it's love that's rare these days.\n"

Having promised to cease singing at 8:30 p.m., the marchers did so. Although petitioners and the other demonstrators continued to march in a completely lawful fashion, the onlookers became unruly as the number of bystanders increased. Chicago police, to prevent what they regarded as an impending civil disorder, demanded that the demonstrators, upon pain of arrest, disperse. When this command was not obeyed, petitioners were arrested for disorderly conduct. \\n\\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois suggests that petitioners were convicted not for the manner in which they conducted their march but rather for their refusal to dispense when requested to do so by Chicago police.  However reasonable the police request may have been and however laudable the police motives, petitioners were charged and convicted for holding a demonstration, not for a refusal to obey a police officer.\n"

The song \"Wish\", aided by the video directed by Peter 'Sleazy' Christopherson of Coil, won a Grammy in the \"metal\" category. Jon Reiss directed a music video for \"Happiness in Slavery,\" which was almost universally banned due to its graphic content. The video depicts performance artist Bob Flanagan strapping himself to a machine that subsequently pleasures, tortures and kills him. A video for \"Pinion\" aired twice on MTV before being banned for its objectionable content, although images from it did become a fixture in the opening title sequence of the MTV show Alternative Nation. A full length video informally called The Broken Movie was also made by Sleazy, but has not seen an official release. The Broken Movie, as of 2005, can only be found on bootleg.

I just wonder if I should consider it flirting or just being nice.  Guys, can you give me some insight as to how much, if any, you notice what a woman is wearing and would you go out of your way to compliment it if you weren't attracted to her?  Thanks!\nAnswer: Well, remember always that nearly all men are created simple. If we compliment a woman on her clothing, we have usually recognised her as attractive. And this we do for the only thing we like more than sports on TV: \"sports in bed\".\\nI admit that lots of men will be very angry now and say: \"I am not bad like that! Of course I would compliment her if she wears nice pants or else!\"\\nSorry, guys, we're too simple to think such complexe thoughts. When you recognise her by her pants, you have already checked her body on matching. Lots of sociologists are saying the same: Men want to have as much descendants as possible. This is evolution, guys - no chance to deny.\\nTo  return to your question: If two different men were complimenting you on your pants they were of course flirting! Or you wore some kind of mini-pants...\\nWhen a man notices a woman's clothing, he is interested in her. Think of the lot of husbands not recognising that you were at the hairdresser! Normally the first thing a man checks on a woman is her decolleté (do you say so?), the second one is her \"deep back\", the third one are her lips and the fourth (!!!) thing are her eyes.\\nEveryone else protesting that he looks at first in her eyes should check up his sex - evolution made us always looking for the ideal partner for \"producing descendants\". That's why men are so simple to understand but women are a big puzzle for each other. She has to think about lots of risks awaiting her in pregnancy and after - he has to think only about the best \"gen pool\".\\nI'm sorry for using some prejudices, but all of them are true...\n"

In many schools architecture is the most competitive major.  \\n\\nBe sure that you go to a school with a 5 year or 4+2 program.  You do not want to be \"pre-architecture.\"  That qualifies you for nothing.  I did a 5 year program at Ball State (good program) but many schools are switching to Masters instead of Bachelors, but honestly, most firms know someone with a 5 year B-Arch is as qualified (sometimes more) then someone with a Masters, so that should not be your guide.  \\n\\nI agree with the above schools.  But here is my advice on finding a good school.\\n\\n I'd stay away from \"big names.\"  You need to be taught by real professors in studio classes and not by grad assistants.  Where ever you go look for that.  Also look for a school that leaves the building open 24-7, closing an architecture building at 12 or 1 is a huge pain for students who have to bring drawings and stuff home to finish (all nighters are normal for architure students from year one.)  Look for a school that offers cross displinary minors worked into your cirriculum, so often architecture majors never get to take classes outside their major, pretty depressing.

If you haven't done so, you can find the default IP address assigned to it in the manual. something like 198.0.0.1, then plug that IP in  the address bar in your browser and you will be prompted to enter the user name and password. which is by default usually user: admin password: administrator or vice versa. You can also check what your firewall IP is by going to the start menu, selecting run, and typing cmd then press enter. a dos window opens and you type ipconfig, then press enter, some info is returned the gateway IP is your firewall/router IP address. Once logged through the browser go to the advanced or security tab and make the necessary adjustments. for more step by step instructions I suggest visiting the manufacuter web site, consulting the manual, or googling something like \"setting up secure wireless network Linksys (or whatever)\"\n"

Have you ever dealt with this problem.  Please help!  I can't sit through an hour of interactive class and be miserable!\nAnswer: ask if you can change classes if its offered at a different time or otherwise you will have to talk to the teacher and have her move him somewhere away from you,  maybe sit by an open window.  Or you could talk to him personaly and explain your allergy to him, and maybe he will be cool about it and skip the cig. before that class.\n"

He said, wait a minute, if you let me explain the circumstances, you'd see that I'm still eligible (it is called a \"hearing\" when someone is allowed to come in and tell their side of the story).  The state said, fine, you can come tell us about the situation (we'll give you a \"hearing\"), but first we are going to terminate the payments.  If, after hearing your side of the story, we think you are still eligible, then we will start making the payments again.

So he sued the state.\\n\\nThe state argued that it would be too expensive and time consuming to give all welfare recipients a pre-termination hearing.\\n\\nThe case went all the way to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court decided that it was unfair to terminate the payments without first hearing the guy's explanation of why he was still eligible.

In the words of the court: \"The interest of the eligible recipient in the uninterrupted receipt of public assistance, which provides him with essential food, clothing, housing, and medical care, coupled with the State's interest that his payments not be erroneously terminated, clearly outweighs the State's competing concern to prevent any increase in its fiscal and administrative burdens.\"\\n\\nWhat \"vocab\" don't you understand?\n"

People normally breathe in their chest. You can tell if you're using chest breathing because your shoulders rise and fall. With diaphragm breathing it is the stomach region that moves. Diaphragm breathing is a much deeper breathing than chest breathing. It is also quite difficult to achieve properly. \\n\\nTo manage it, you have to take a slow, deep breath, remembering not to move your chest. Do it standing or lying down; you have to make a conscious effort to get the air into your stomach (this doesn't really happen, but it feels like it. The reason diaphragmatic breathing gets more air into you is that the diaphragm muscle stretches the lungs so that most of them fill up with air. It helps to have a hand on your stomach, or to have someone watching you and telling you that you're moving your shoulders. You can also lie down and put a pile of books on your stomach, so that you can see whenever they rise or fall. When you breathe out, try to keep your stomach (and the books) up, by keeping the diaphragm tense.\\n\\nIt's quite difficult, but practice makes perfect. :)\\n\\nP.S.: \"Many Mockingbirds are actually mimicking Cell Phone ring-tones now.\"\\n\\nLol snagelfritz!!!

If the salaries that movie stars and pro athletes bothers you - then make a statement and do not support those industries.  It has been years since I went to a movie because I am bothered by the amount of money that they make.  I know that my 7 or 8 dollars they loose every week is not making a difference - but in my mind I am making a statement.  I also do not buy or support the pro-athletes because of the money they make and because of the statement that is shown to kids who look up to them.  I may be standing alone on a soap box - but come on... they get arrested... use drugs... beat their wives or girlfriends... and the media puts them up as a role model.\\nSome suggestions that I do have if you are trying to improve your income - put your resume out there on Monster - never know what could happen and it might help... also maybe take some classes to get more education under your belt - do not know what your educational background is - but there are financial means out there to go to college and gain more education.\\nGood luck and don't let this get you down!\n"

We have domesticated animals through the years for companionship, entertainment and pleasure. Now, animals normally kept in a zoo are never socialized to the point of being a pet and I do believe they should be left to their natural habitat. I have never been to a circus because I believe so strongly that the animals are made to perform things that they aren't supposed to do and would never do in nature. I won't support them. The danger for animals that depend on us are great when left to fend for themselves. They have been domesticated and therefore are dependent on us as their providers. I can see that in the near future though, with land and timber being developed for human convenience we are going to see a lot more \"born-free\" animals close to our houses. They are running out of natural habitat and have to relocate. But, I'm just as sure that humans will kill them without considering that we have destroyed where their home was and they have to go somewhere.\n"

        "sentence": "Question: What is the Definition of Low Islands?\nAnswer: B.Types of Islands: Low Islands\\nLike the high islands, low islands are also further classified into two subgroups: eroded volcanic islands and atolls. The eroded volcanic islands are much like the oceanic, or volcanic, high islands, only they have been eroded to such a point that they are barely above sea level. Examples of these islands include the smaller, lower islands of Hawaii.\\n\\nAtolls are a series of islands that form a rough ring enclosing a central body of water called a lagoon. The various islets of the ring are called motus and are separated by sea channels that lead into the lagoon. An atoll is continually built upward from an underlying coral reef, itself formed from the skeleton of a tiny, lime-secreting animal called a polyp. Typically, some parts of an atoll are above sea level while other parts remain below. Many scientists believe that atolls were once the fringing reef around volcanic islands that have subsided below the ocean surface. In a subset of atolls, known as raised atolls, geologic action has elevated the coralline limestone above the surrounding sea. Nauru and Niue are examples of raised atolls. Examples of other atolls include most of the Marshalls, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tokelau, and the Cook Islands. Although most atolls are tiny, some—probably those that once surrounded large volcanic peaks—are quite large. Kwajalein, in the Marshall Islands, is the world’s largest atoll in terms of its diameter around the lagoon, with a length of 130 km (80 mi) and a width of 32 km (20 mi). Kwajalein’s land area, however, is only 16 sq km (6 sq mi). Kiritimati, in Kiribati, is the largest atoll in terms of land area, with a total area of about 390 sq km (150 sq mi).\n"
