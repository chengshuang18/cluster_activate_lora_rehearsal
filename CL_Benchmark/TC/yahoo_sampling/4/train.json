Firstly, being \"passionate\" about your service/product doesn't necessarily mean that you dream about it night and day and climb onto a couch and bounce around while discussing its merits. It simply means that you convincingly believe that the offering is a valuable one. Realistically you also understand that this value may differ depending upon the needs of your potential clients.\\n\\nAnd so, a sales person may be passionate about Honda's because they realize that a Honda can be an extremely cost efficient and reliable automobile with strong performance for a consumer that values those attributes. However, if the defining attribute that the consumer is looking for is prestige, the Honda sales person will appreciate that a BMW or Mercedes may be a better fit.

If there are 4 grams of the isotope remaining after 21,500 years, how many grams were there originally????\nAnswer: \"Give a student an answer, and their grade on that assignment will go up a point, teach them how to find their answer and their score on the final exam will improve!\"\\n\\nRadioactive decay is an exponential thing; for every 24000 years that elapses in this problem, half the remaining material vanishes.  If you express this as an algebraic equation you can figure this stuff out easily.  The hard part is figuring out the equation.\\n\\nLets say you start out with X_0 grams of material.  The amount of material remaining is X: \\n\\nX= X_0*(1/2)^(t/24000)\\n\\nWhere t is given in years.  See how this works?  if t = 0, then X=X_0*1/2^0 power.  Anything raised to the 0 is always 1, so X=X_0.  At t=24000 years, X=X_0*1/2^(1), so X=X_0*1/2; half as much is left.\\n\\nIn this problem you are given t, and X and are asked to find X_0 so  you use a calculator to turn 1/2^(21500/24000) into just a number and then you have\\n\\n4 grams=X_0*number\\n\\nPretty easy to solve that for X_0.  The point is, once you write down the equation that describes the system, you can manipulate it to solve for any of the terms in it, as long as you know the other two terms.\\n\\nIncidentally, I get a different answer than those other two folks who agree with one another.

I FEEL LIKE WE MADE PLANS AND HE KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY KIDS... I ALSO FEEL HE SHOULDN'T HAVE MARRIED AND BEEN A FATHER TO MY NOW 9MONTH OLD SON.. IF HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO. HE HAS BEEN IN MY SONS LIFE AS HIS FATHER SINCE MY SON WAS 2WEEKS OLD AND NOW HE WANTS TO JUST UP AND LEAVE AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE OKAY WITH...THAT HOW DO I STOP THE EVIL THOUGHTS RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD I'M SO HURT I THINK I'M SLIDING INTO A DEEP DEPRESSION......HELP WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nAnswer: At least part of what you should do is wait. I'm a man. All men want to leave progeny. It is a biological imperitive. It sounds like he's just jealous. I hope to God your 9 month old isn't shunned by your new husband.\\n\\nMen want kids (whether they admit it or not--see, there's a macho component to \"siring\" off-spring, it is medieval, outgrown). \\n\\nSome argue that humans, like other mammals, will only care for, really care for, their own kids-- with their genes. I don't buy this. All of us alive today share genes. It's one family, for real.\\n\\nBut this guy may be trying to incite a kind of hurt in you (he's succeeding) because it hurts him that he didn't father the 3/9 month old. Get it? But he'll come around! I promise.\\n\\nI don't get why he did this either, if he knew about the 3-month old-he went back on his promise. Is he compulsive? Are you wealthy with your own money? People are not logical most times. That's why \"game theory\" doesn't work at the Pentagon or on Wall Street. We do things for neurotic, maybe self-destructive reasons. Maybe you need outside help. A marraige counselor, a shrink or two. \\n\\nDid anything change? Did he meet someone else? Think about that kind of thing. How long did you know him before marrying him, 2 1/2 months. Or maybe 3???? If so, that's not long enough. Is your Mom still alive? She'd be angry at you. Oh, I just got it:\\n\\nHe thinks you married him ONLY so he'll take care of your child from another person. You need a breadwinner, or at least two bread winner's, to raise a kid these days, so you married him solely so as to care for, pay for, your child.... I bet that is it. Still, you guys had wanted kids've your own, which makes it all even and ok. So there's something missing from your question. Btw, I'd get to a shrink about that depression. True major depression is crippling and life-threatening. Use words with care. True depression (clinical sense) is endogenous, of the body and heritable. So be careful.\\n\\nRemind the guy that one doesn't use one's kid(s) as \"weapons\" to fight the spouse with... which everyone does anyway. There's more to this: you've left out or I missed something critical. But here's the general deal:\\n\\nFirst, wait patiently. He'll change his mind again. He wants kids, we all do (us guys). If he doesn't change in, say, 6 months, he's got or having a kid with someone else I'd bet. Ask. If so he'll be a financial mess I shd think.\\n\\nAlso: tell him all about what it means to be a Dad, really be a Dad; and that, yes, you want HIM, you chose him, to be this child's Dad.\\n\\nTell him every damn day. For a month at least.\\n\\nFinally, use sex as a weapon if you have to. Be creative. You know what he likes? Use that knowledge to give it to him, if you love him.\\n\\nHey, how to change the mind of the most stubborn guys, even in the Bible, that vixen got Sampson to cut his hair.... (Delilah, now I recall.) Making him weak (impotent). The story is saying that civilizing a man takes some of his power away. That hurts him.\\n\\nSo get ready to remind him, in about one month:\\nBeing a Dad, in reality, is much more than biological parenting and soccer practice. Anyone can do that.

Nabby was that way for a while, Toskala now.\\n\\nLike any other position, I think the best goalies reinvent the game at their level.  They own the plays, the net, their role on the team, and I don't think that necessarily amounts to leadership, but it does come from things like maturity and a certain solid footing.  Um, no pun intended.\\n\\nI think some of the things I look for in a goalie I play with in rec are similar in pro hockey.  I don't like goalies who fall apart after letting one or two in, or goalies who are inflexible in their approach, which means they can only shut out certain teams and only if we defend a certain way in front of them.\\n\\nI like playing with goalies who are fluid about the game, not prima donnas, who can clear their own crease if they have to and who can and will drive the game from the net if the situation warrants it.  Goaltending isn't for the fainthearted, and there's some wussy goalies out there.  I don't think, long term rec or pro, they do very well.\\n\\nI was sad to see Shields go so completely downhill.

Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung are excellent authors to start with. Christians basically believe what every other faith believes. Their way is the only TRUE path to God. In my opinion (as a Christian) that's incredibly narrow-minded. If you've read the Chronicles of Narnia (and if you haven't you should) the last chapter of book 7 \"The last Battle\" has a scene where Aslan (Christ) allows a young man who was a follower of Tash (another god/demon) into the real Narnia (Heaven) because his actions were congruent with the Aslan's teachings even though the young man didn't realize it.

Thanks!\nAnswer: The one thing I think about is when I bought a rental property, I made my offer, not knowing about negotiating tactics.  The buyer agent had me sign a dual agency agreement, and I don't think he had my best interests at heart. I offered a low price and ended up paying full price.  I was naive to the fact that he was not on my side, and also, I should have asked for closing costs or some other bargaining chip.  And I should have stood my ground on the slightly lower price, after coming up some.  Being in the investor shoes, the buyer needed me more than I needer her.  I could've walked away, but she needed to sell.  So she probably would've taken the lower price had I stopped.  Overall, I do not regret the investment, it was good, I am also lucky because I didn't order an inspection!!!  (Naive again) Lucky it was in good shape.  But it also could've been a bargaining chip.

It was originally released in a fold-out format, containing the first six tracks on a regular CD and an additional three-inch mini-CD with the remaining bonus tracks. It was later released as one CD, with the bonus songs as \"hidden\" tracks 98 and 99. The song \"Wish\", aided by the video directed by Peter 'Sleazy' Christopherson of Coil, won a Grammy in the \"metal\" category. Jon Reiss directed a music video for \"Happiness in Slavery,\" which was almost universally banned due to its graphic content. The video depicts performance artist Bob Flanagan strapping himself to a machine that subsequently pleasures, tortures and kills him. A video for \"Pinion\" aired twice on MTV before being banned for its objectionable content, although images from it did become a fixture in the opening title sequence of the MTV show Alternative Nation. A full length video informally called The Broken Movie was also made by Sleazy, but has not seen an official release. The Broken Movie, as of 2005, can only be found on bootleg. Broken was followed by the remix EP Fixed.\n"

Three cars and a truck had hit each other on the slick over pass of a bridge and all the traffic was at a stop. We were close enough that I could take out my camera and take a photo of the scene. Yes, I know. How morbid but I did it anyway. When I had the film developed the picture had this white, misty thing above on of the cars that had what appeared to be wispy wings moving off the photo edge. I didn’t even know what it was until my friend grabbed my arm and told me that I had a photo of a guardian angel. I was amazed and ever since I’m sure angels exist.\n"

Is it better than what I currently have which is a hyper prostaff 6.1 95.\nAnswer: This is really a matter of preferance, they are both good frames.  I have used the Wilson 6.1 classic prostaff for years and it is comparable to the two frames you have listed.  The hyper prostaff will have a slightly larger sweetspot with the larger head size, but I have heard good things about the ncode six-one tour.  Another racket to consider which I have recently played with is the Head liquidmetal prestige red frame.  It has a denser string pattern but suprisingly generates a generous amount of spin.  Actually it took me about 3 days of hitting before i really started liking the Head Prestige, but it was time well spent.  You may want to change to the n-code for no other reason except the hyper prostaff could be discontinued in the near future.  Anyways, good luck with your choice.\n"

AND YES HEARTS FANS DID NOTICE. that's why there was alot off us very worried. and yes some jambos did have there blind folds on when it came to him. but at long last they have woken up. I admit they should have woken up when he sacked George Burley. When was the last time you Heard GOD GAVE ME ROMANOV at any HEARTS game not be for some time now. I have only missed 3 away games due to work have been to all home games never heard it once. HEARTS FANS DO  SUPPORT  though thick and thin glory hunting is the last thing you can call a hearts fan. NO Matter where HEARTS play I will be there. But in saying that if Mr Romanov fills MY HEARTS TEAM WITH ALL LITHUANIANS I WILL NOT BUY A NEW SEASON TICKET.\n"

Many of them are listed by some of these replies. Yes they are real.\\n\\nThey were set up by FHA and heavily lobbied by AARP in order to help Senior citizens because they know that social security and pensions do not cut it for a lot of people.\\n\\nI recommend going to aarp to find some really helpful information.\\n\\nhttp://www.aarp.org/money/revmort/...\\n\\nor here for the most frequently asked questions..\\n\\nhttp://www.griffinloans.com/faqs.html...\\n\\nThere really is only one downside to taking out a reverse mortgage. The children are not left with 100% of the value of the home for an inheritance. From my experience and my own personal view, most children would want their parents to live their life to the fullest and don't care if part of their inheritance is reduced. It is YOUR home and you worked hard to pay for it. You should enjoy the benefits of it.\\n\\nThe house is still in your name it just shows that there is a mortgage on the home like any other conventional mortgage. You can take the full amount in a lump sum, split it up in monthly payments or leave it in a line of credit which right now has a growth rate of about 7%. With the line of credit you are only charged interest on what you pull out of the line of credit and that interest rate right now is right around 6.5%. The rest of the money sits there untouched until you need it. These loans are set up so that there should always be equity in the home to pass along to your heirs. Also, you can repay the loan at anytime with no prepayment penalty.\\n\\nAll of this money is tax free and there are no monthly payments to make. You CAN make a payment if you want and are concerned about keeping the balance down. You even get a tax break if you pay back the interest you are being charged.\\n\\nThis is a much better option than a home equity loan which you have to make high monthly payments and if something happens and they get behind could lose their home. With an FHA reverse mortgage there is NO way to ever lose your home or be foreclosed on.\\n\\nSo really the only downside to reverse mortgages is that the heirs wouldn't get 100% of the home value for your inheritance.\\n\\nI'd be happy to send you some more information if you would like. This is what I specialize in and our company can do reverses almost anywhere in the country. If you would like some more information please email me at bburns@griffinloans.com\n"
