I came across one channel that was totally in Spanish, probably the telemundo channel.  Anyway rey mysterio was cutting a promo( obviously in Spanish) in the ring   This was not wwe tv, but I think it was some kind of lucha liebre promotion.  So he was cutting a promo and apparently called out MNM. Suddenly out of nowhere, johhny nitro, joey mercurey, and melina walk out of the crowd and over the security wall or gate, and enter the ring.  Nitro and Murcurey were dressed in jeans and there MNM gimmick fur coats, but no shirts on. Melina had on her regular flashy attire. Rey was dressed in a suit and jeans.  suddenly a ref comes out and we have a match. A masked mexican wrestler enters the ring to be rey's partner. The match starts with a typical MNM type match and goes back and forth. When rey is tagged he starts cleaning house.  Finally he hits the 619 and hurracanrana off the top rope with a suit on for the win!!! What was I watching?\nAnswer: recently some of the wwe wrestlers did go to mexico to shoot some promotions---maybe it was one of them.\n"

You can't! But if, as most people think, you've lived the experience before, you should have no problem remembering what is to follow. Here's why you can never remember what will follow. When we experience anything, our brain records it and stores it as a memory. Then that memory is \"filed\" so that when we recall it, we can determine the sequence of the event, i.e. was this recent, or years ago? When the brain \"misfiles' a current event as being something in the past, it recognizes that event and we feel we've experienced it before. But actually, our brain is comparing the current event to itself! That's why we can never follow through with what happens next...because it hasn't happened yet! And that, my friend is deja vu!\n"

        "sentence": "Question: Why does the ozone layer deplete?\nAnswer: Ozone destruction\\n\\nChemical factors\\nOzone can be destroyed by a number of free radical catalysts, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), \\nnitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). All of these radicals have both natural and anthropogenic (manmade) sources. At the present time, most of the OH and NO in the stratosphere is of natural origin, but human activity has dramatically increased the chlorine and bromine. These elements are found in certain stable compounds, especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which may find their way to the stratosphere and there be liberated by the action of ultraviolet light. Most importantly, the chlorine atoms so generated destroy ozone molecules in a catalytic cycle. In this cycle, a chlorine atom reacts with an ozone molecule, taking an oxygen atom with it (forming ClO) and leaving a normal oxygen molecule. A free oxygen atom then takes away the oxygen from the ClO, and the final result is an oxygen molecule and a chlorine atom, which then reinitiates the cycle. A single chlorine atom would keep on destroying ozone forever were it not for reactions that remove them from this cycle by forming reservoir species such as hydrochloric acid and chlorine nitrate. On a per atom basis, bromine is even more efficient than chlorine at destroying ozone, but there is much less bromine in the atmosphere at present. As a result, both chlorine and bromine contribute significantly to the overall ozone depletion.\\n\\nPolar stratospheric clouds\\nThe reactivation of atomic chlorine from these reservoir species is normally slow, but is enhanced by the presence of polar stratospheric clouds which appear during Antarctic winters, leading to a strong seasonal cycle in ozone hole formation.\\n\\nFor more info go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion\n"

What kind of action can I take against this woman?

The police don't settle Deed issues, she hasn't done anything crazy enough for dhhr to get involved, and the dog hasn't been ruled vicious.  You are going about this all the wrong way, and all you are doing is frustrating yourself.  You are asking people to do things that are not in their power to do.\\n\\nYou need to first check the Deeds and proceed with a complaint filed in Municipal Court against her if you are truly in the right as per your Deeds.

I took the first part which was a simple agree, strongly agree, disagree, and strongly disagree test.

Do you do well interacting with people?\\n\\nComputers can be great, but there is a wide variety in the field, and the technology is always changing. You will have to learn new things constantly, even once shool is done. You will have to be committed to learning on your own consistently for a lifetime.\n"

Players on the move towards the basket frequently take \"extra steps\" without being called for it - but the relative freedom to violate the traveling rule is what has changed basketball from the old-time game of \"set shot\" shooting (standing still) to the more exciting modern game of \"driving\" and \"dunking\".\n"

A democracy (means rule by the people in latin) is when the people vote on each and every issue that comes up.  A 'rep'ublic (based on the same word as 'rep'resentative in latin) is when we elect representatives (president, representative, senator, governor, legislator, and so on) to represent us on each of these issues.\\n\\nNow I do agree with your argument about bringing it to the US.  In the 2004 election only 28% of population voted, as compared to the 70% in Israel, the 78% in Iraq when they first voted.

        "sentence": "Question: Everything i think of is operant conditioning, in terms of parenting.I cant for the life of me think of any cl\nAnswer: The importance of empathy for moral socialisation was one of the reason for the development of the violence inhibition mechanism model of psychopathy.34 43 44 This model was also prompted by work suggesting that most social animals possess mechanisms for the control of aggression.45 46 They noted that submission cues displayed to a conspecific aggressor terminate attacksfor example, an aggressor dog will cease fighting if its opponent bares its throat. The violence inhibition mechanism (VIM) is considered to be a functionally similar mechanism in humans where sad facial affects (distress cues) function as a human submission response. At its simplest, the VIM is thought to be a system that when activated by distress cues, the sad and fearful expressions of others, results in increased autonomic activity, attention and activation of the brain stem threat response system (usually resulting in freezing).43 According to the model, moral socialisation occurs through the pairing of the activation of the mechanism by distress cues with representations of the acts which caused the distress cues (moral transgressionsfor example, one person hitting another).43 A process of classical conditioning results in these representations of moral transgressions becoming triggers for the mechanism. The appropriately developing child thus initially finds the pain of others' aversive and then, through socialisation, thoughts of acts that cause pain to others aversive also. \\n\\nBlair has proposed that psychopathic persons have had disruption to this system such that representations of acts that cause harm to others do not become triggers for the VIM.43 This is thought to occur because the signal to the learning system concerning emotionally aversive stimuli is mutedthat is, the unconditioned stimulus (US) signal is diminished, thus impairing the formation of US-conditioned stimulus (CS) associations. Certainly, the autonomic response of psychopathic persons to the aversive US of sad and fearful facial expressions is muted relative to controls.34 At the neural level, this has been attributed to dysfunction within the amygdala.23 47\n"

In those places, certain murderers are condemned to be executed by the state. There are two commonly cited reasons for this. First, public knowledge that a death penalty exists and can be administered is supposed to deter would-be murderers from killing.To say it in the easy, first-person way- If I know that I could get punished with death because I kill someone, that will theoretically make me hesitate to kill a person. Secondly, the people of some states are of the opinion that it is less costly to execute a convicted murderer than to keep that person in prison for life, but the calculations as to the cost-efficiency are not conclusive.  The expressed attitude seems to be that once a person has killed, that person cannot be trusted not to kill again and must be removed from society.\\nIn actual practice, the families of murder victims frequently talk about seeking closure, saying that only the death of the murderer will bring them peace.  That seems like revenge to me. rather than a noble social aim.  It is pretty insensitive of me to even discuss such matters.  Can I declare myself morally superior to others and say that it is wrong to seek revenge? I have no such right.  I can only say that the desire for revenge is the driving force behind much of the violence in the world today. I can only say that if we could get away from the idea of revenge, many violent acts would not happen.\\nI would like to give one last bit of food for thought: when humans act alone and independantly, we do not always take the time to fully justify our morality, but when we act as a society- by making laws- we need to have morals that we can explain.\\nThank you for asking an important question.\n"

WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?!\nAnswer: I haven't seen the frilly panty ones but I agree that the creepy king is just weird. They even called him I think \"freaky king guy\" in the superbowl commercial. They're just going for shock value, trying to appeal to a new generation and get them loyal to the BK name. Did you notice how fast the \"coq rock\" band went away? (the guys for the chicken fries-coq is french for chicken) apparently the whole band name and marketing scheme was computer generated and they didn't realize how suggestive it was. Well, that's what they claim. Nobody puts anything into advertising accidentally, that's the first rule of marketing.\n"

It is true that, in a garrison environment, most marines (save flight crews, CFR, SAR, PMO, & some others) enjoy a very relaxed work week- I say this viewing it from the other side- I was an MP who worked on average 60 hours a week- literally almost twice the hours most other Marines worked.    \\nIn that sense, being admin, or cook, or stich b*tch is cake, but as the first guy said, deployments happen. A LOT.  In that case, virtually every one will be required to work in extreme conditions (including combat) and for ungodly periods of time.  There is a mission to be accomplished, regardless of any other concern.  As hard and dangerous as it may be, it is strangly satisfying and kinda fun- in a masochistic way.  I got out in May- and love being a bearded  nasty civilian- but I really miss it like crazy.  \\n\\nWhatever you decide, take your time and be sure.  You will never know what it will be like- no one can really tell you what it will do to or for YOU, but at least make your choice with due diligence.\\nHonestly, I really want to help you. Email me if you want.  Just amend your question if you are interested, and I will send you my email.\n"

What branch pays the most on average?\nAnswer: They all pay the same basic pay.  I'm sure the special pay is different for each service.  You can check out the DFAS website, http://www.dod.mil/dfas/.  If you're concerned about your mortgage, you also get a little thing called BAH, Basic Allowance for Housing.  How much you receive is based on rank and duty location.  It's not based on where you live.  For instance, if you are stationed in a high cost area like Washington DC, you will receive more than someone stationed in Indianapolis.  You can check that out yourself, by choosing a service under military pay information.  Then select \"basic pay\" and then click \"current pay rates\".  You should then see a chart for current pay rates and also information about BAH.  Use the calculator to see how much you would get based on the zipcode.\n"
