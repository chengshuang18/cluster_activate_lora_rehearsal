There's all kinds of reasons for this, but I will give you only a couple. I'm writing to you about this with over 33 years of experience and many failed attempts of \"Boxing at home\"\\n\\n   There's the little mistakes that you pick up while you're training at home, dropping your hand as you throw your jab, not shooting your jab straight out, not pivoting on your foot properly when throwing the left hook, stepping straight back with your head up in the air, cat-pawing when you start to get tired. These are the most common of mistakes that everyone starting out training at home does, maybe not all of them but definitely some of them.\\n\\n  Then there's the fact that you're not around the gym atmosphere\\nthe smell of a boxing gym. The subconscious telling you to push yourself harder than the guy hitting the bag next to you. The fact that your being watched by guys/girls who know what they're doing and you want to show that you belong. The fact that the noises that come from a gym give you a rush unlike anything you've ever experienced.\\n\\n   The money you spend on a \"Home Gym\" will be a complete waste, how many times have you bought something you had to have and six months later you thought what a waste? Spend your money on a Gym membership or Gym dues, stay away from Health Clubs like Ballys, Golds Gym, World Gym and countless others who know absolutely nothing about boxing except Rocky's coming out on Christmas.\\n\\n  I understand your position completely, to just stay in shape get yourself a freestanding bag, it's a great way to stay in shape. It's next to impossible to get into the shape you have to be in to actually compete at home, for all the above mentioned reasons and then some.\\n\\n  Good luck.\n"

It may have something to do with our angular measurement system.  The Earth rotates 360° every 24 hours.  Each hour represents 15° of angular rotation.  Each minute of time represents 15 minutes of angular rotation and each second of time represents 15 seconds of angular rotation.  As to where our time measurement system came from, I don't know, but it could probably be found out pretty easily by doing a few searches.\\n\\nCheck this link for books on the subject:\\nhttp://books.google.com/books?q=origin+of+time+measurement&ots=V7_ssegXJ4&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title\n"

        "sentence": "Question: What is the full form of ALOHA protocol ?\nAnswer: ALOHA PROTOCOL:\\n\\nAloha, also called the Aloha method, refers to a simple communications scheme in which each source (transmitter) in a network sends data whenever there is a frame to send.  If the frame successfully reaches the destination (receiver), the next frame is sent.  If the frame fails to be received at the destination, it is sent again.  This protocol was originally developed at the University of Hawaii for use with satellite communication systems in the Pacific.\\n\\nIn a wireless broadcast system or a half-duplex two-way link, Aloha works perfectly.  But as networks become more complex, for example in an Ethernet system involving multiple sources and destinations in which data travels many paths at once, trouble occurs because data frames collide (conflict).  The heavier the communications volume, the worse the collision problems become.  The result is degradation of system efficiency, because when two frames collide, the data contained in both frames is lost.\\n\\nTo minimize the number of collisions, thereby optimizing network efficiency and increasing the number of subscribers that can use a given network, a scheme called slotted Aloha was developed.  This system employs signals called beacons that are sent at precise intervals and tell each source when the channel is clear to send a frame.  Further improvement can be realized by a more sophisticated protocol called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA).\\n\\nIn 1070s, Norman Abram son and his colleagues at the University of Hawaii devised a new and elegant method to solve the channel allocation problem. Many researchers have extended their work since then. Although Abranson's work, called the Aloha System, used ground-based radio broadcasting, the basic idea is applicable to any system in which uncoordinated users are completing for the use of a single shared channel.\n"

Hellllllp!?!\nAnswer: (1) First of all, if it's a brand new computer, and it didn't go through a ton of updates when you first connected it to the internet, go to http://www.windowsupdate.com/ and make sure you've got the latest and greatest from our GREAT friends at Microsoft.  For your issue, this is only pertinent if you're using Internet Explorer, but it's always a good thing to do.\\n\\n(2) Make sure your screen resolution (right click on the desktop, properties, settings) is set to at least 800x600, preferably 1024x768.\\n\\n(3) Make sure the browser window is maximized.\\n\\n(4) Make sure you have IE, or preferably Firefox, from http://www.mozilla.com/\\n\\n(5) Make sure your text size is good.

You may want to see a therapist or hypnosis. I don't know if there is a medication that will make this go away. One way to work on it, is by using exposure therapy. Start practicing doing this, when it isn't necessary, and if you have someone you feel you can trust to tell this too, have them with you as encouragement when you have to sign the documents, and continue on, taking steps to reach the goal of overcoming the neurosis.

I just need to know the basics, like... what does it eat, where is it found, etc.\\n\\nyannow... the basics\nAnswer: Coelacanths are lobe-finned fish with the pectoral and anal fins on fleshy stalks supported by bones, and the tail fin divided into three lobes, the middle one of which also includes a continuation of the notochord. Coelacanths have modified cosmoid scales, which are thinner than true cosmoid scales, which can only be found on extinct fish. Coelacanths also have a special electroreceptive device called a rosteral organ in the front of the skull, which probably helps in prey detection.\\n\\nCoelacanths first appear in the fossil record in the Middle Devonian, about 390 million years ago. Prehistoric species of coelacanth lived in many bodies of water in Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic times.\\n\\nThe average weight of the coelacanth is 176 pounds (80 kg) and they can reach up to 6.5 feet (2 m) in length. Scientists believe individual coelacanths may live as long as 60 years.\\n\\nThey are the only living species known to have a functional intracranial joint, which almost completely separates the front and back halves of the skull internally. Flexure at this joint may aid in the consumption of large prey. Coelacanths are also mucilaginous; their scales release mucus and their bodies continually exude oil. This oil is a laxative, and makes the fish almost inedible unless dried and salted. Their scales are very rough, and are used by the villagers of the Comoros as sandpaper.\\n\\nCoelacanth eyes are very sensitive, and have a tapetum lucidum. Coelacanths are almost never caught in the daytime or on nights with full moons, due to the sensitivity of their eyes.\\n\\nCoelacanths are opportunistic feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, and other fish found in their deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards and belly up to locate their prey presumably utilizing its rosteral gland. Scientists suspect that one reason this fish has been so successful is that they can slow down their metabolisms at any time, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements in a sort of hibernation mode.\n"

It really doesn't matter as the only thing I'm ever going to say to her again is \"SIGN THE DAMN PAPERS\" but I really feel she has sociopathic qualities and might need professional help.\\n\\nAny feedback is appreciated...\nAnswer: I'm going through the same thing.  Stay strong.  Stick with your gut feel.  She very well may be a sociopath but that's entirely up to her to get professional help.  My therapist outright told my wife to get help.  My wife insists there's nothing wrong with her.\n"

In my state we do obtain court orders to pay, but if the payer falls behind they administratively ADD an arrears payment without notifying either party.  So yes, it can be done.   There are some cases where CSAs allow the payer to pay without garnishing his wages, but again--if he fails to pay or falls behind--they will immediately send out the income withholding to the employer.  Please don't assume it was at your ex's request.  Agencies are under a lot of pressure to keep payers current or they lose 'federal incentives' to their respective agencies.

I came across one channel that was totally in Spanish, probably the telemundo channel.  Anyway rey mysterio was cutting a promo( obviously in Spanish) in the ring   This was not wwe tv, but I think it was some kind of lucha liebre promotion.  So he was cutting a promo and apparently called out MNM. Suddenly out of nowhere, johhny nitro, joey mercurey, and melina walk out of the crowd and over the security wall or gate, and enter the ring.  Nitro and Murcurey were dressed in jeans and there MNM gimmick fur coats, but no shirts on. Melina had on her regular flashy attire. Rey was dressed in a suit and jeans.  suddenly a ref comes out and we have a match. A masked mexican wrestler enters the ring to be rey's partner. The match starts with a typical MNM type match and goes back and forth. When rey is tagged he starts cleaning house.  Finally he hits the 619 and hurracanrana off the top rope with a suit on for the win!!! What was I watching?\nAnswer: recently some of the wwe wrestlers did go to mexico to shoot some promotions---maybe it was one of them.\n"

The thinness of air and difficulty breathing and tiring from physical exertion occurs around 5,000 feet or even 6,000 feet or higher. Now 2,000 meters, that would have an impact with altitude. However, I believe goats are much faster than chickens so the answer is no, a chicken cannot outrun a goat a 200 meters above sea level. I believe a goat would easily outdistance the chicken in a race without any problems whatsoever. No contest. A chicken only runs about 9 miles per hour. A goat is much faster.\\n\\nAlso, if you scroll down to the bottom of this second link you will see the speeds of various animals.\n"

Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung are excellent authors to start with. Christians basically believe what every other faith believes. Their way is the only TRUE path to God. In my opinion (as a Christian) that's incredibly narrow-minded. If you've read the Chronicles of Narnia (and if you haven't you should) the last chapter of book 7 \"The last Battle\" has a scene where Aslan (Christ) allows a young man who was a follower of Tash (another god/demon) into the real Narnia (Heaven) because his actions were congruent with the Aslan's teachings even though the young man didn't realize it. Basically I believe that those who are following Christ's spirit or philosophy even if they're not doing so in name have as much if not more truth than most christians.\n"

Plz help by showing the work.\nAnswer: Since it is a direct variation we can use the formula\\n\\ny = k x\\n\\nSince we are given the ordered pair (2,4) we know y=4 when x=2. Plugging these values into the formula gives us\\n\\n4 = k(2)\\n\\nTo solve for k we divide both sides by 2 which gives us\\n\\nk = 2.\\n\\nIt would also be correct to set up the variation to be\\n\\nx = k y\\n\\nIn this case, we do the same procedures to find k. Plug in the known values for x and y to get that k = 1/2. Unless you are told which one to solve for either are correct. If you are given a multiple choice test I would think that only one could be a possible answer, unless you are first given the variation equation.\n"

Why is this?\nAnswer: Most likely, you are developing gingivitis. It often can be reversed by adopting good dental hygiene habits, which include regular brushing and flossing, as well as twice-yearly dental visits for thorough teeth examinations and cleaning. Once you begin treatment, you will need to continue to see your dentist regularly in order to reverse gum disease. Also, incorporate an anti-gingivitis mouth wash, if you haven't already.\n"

This is a brand new question.\\n\\nI want to explore the nature of the number 0.\\n\\nI would like to know what benefits and consequences would occur if we treated 0 as a non-reducible number equal to 1 divided by infinity and gave is a clever symbol, like z, much the same way we treat i equal to the square root of negative 1.\\n\\nI beleive doing this could solve quite a few conundrums, including 0/0.\\n\\nI beleive the key is redefining how we think of the number 0 and admitting that there is no such thing 0.\\n\\nComments?\nAnswer: 0 in modern algebra is the additive identity. Given a function + that assigns a number to a pair of numbers, 0 is the unique number such that +(0, a) = +(a, 0) = a for every number in the set. Without 0, most of the richness of modern mathematics and proofs would be buried in cases or would be quite impossible (There are many rings, groups, fields, vector spaces, monoids, and a menagerie of other algebraic structures around us). All these structures have some sort of identity element that provides an amazing amount of additional implied structure just by existing (An example you may be familiar with is calculus; it reduces nonlinear forms to linear vector fields at each point. The existence of the 0 linear map, studied in linear algebra, lends a plethora of structure to calculus, allowing us to find extrema, curvature, invariants, etc.). As linear algebra is also used extensively in the study of differential geometry/equations, modern physics is built around the properties of 0. It is the keystone in so many proofs that without it, they would either be irreducibly ugly or would not be true at all.\\n\\nAs to your definition of 1/infty being 0, many number systems that include infty also have 1/infty = 0. Such systems include the affinely extended real numbers and the compactification of the complex plane. These structures are very useful in complex analysis/topology. Neither of them are fields.
