Many also assume this because they judge us inexperienced and irresponsible. There is the problem that some young people are irresponsible and reckless too.

        "sentence": "Question: What is Barmuda Triangle?\nAnswer: The Bermuda Triangle has a reputation for being an area where ships and airplanes dissappear, often under mysterious circumstances. This reputation came to public awareness in the 1950s and became a household name in the 1970s, mostly due to \"The Bermuda Triangle\", a bestselling book written by Charles Berlitz.\\n\\nVarious explanations for the apparent high number of dissapperances have been put forward, ranging from the mundane to the hyper-fantastic.\\n\\nSkeptics contend that this region has a comparable rate of maritime and aerial incidents as any other similar sized region of the ocean. They point out that Lloyd's of London, a world-reknowned insurer of maritime vessels, does not charge a higher insurance premium for ships that regularly traverse the triangle.\\n\\nScientific considerations for an increased dissaperance rate take into acount that this region experiences severe tropical storms and is the source of many hurricanes. These storms create an increased danger to both ship and air traffic.\\n\\nRougue waves have also been put forward as a possible cause. These rare waves can reach heights of as much as 100 feet (30 meters), easily swamping most ships. Rouge waves, however, would have no effect on air travel.\\n\\nA third scientific explanation is methane hydrates. Methane deposits on the ocean floor may release bursts of methane gas that reduces the density of the water it permeates. Since ships rely on displacement to stay afloat, a reduction of density in the water would cause a ship to immediately sink. As the methane leaves the water and rises into the air, it would reduce the density of the air as well, thus reducing lift on aircraft, causing them to descend rapidly. In addition, the methane would change the air mixture taken into the engines of the aircraft, causing the engine to stall. While these events have not been witnessed in nature, they have been proven in lab experiments.\\n\\nMore exotic explanations for the Bermuda Triangle include it being an area of magnetic disturbance, temporal (or time) holes, the location of the lost city of Atlantis, or extra-terrestrial abduction.\n"

However, I haven't been able to really put my finger on why.  Of course, what's not to like about animes, mangas, and fics with lots of hot, steamy sex?  But I mean the yaoi and slash genres in particular.  I know the fandom for these genres is largely young adult women.  Any theories why?\nAnswer: Yes, several - I'm not sure if any of them is \"right\", though.\\n\\nSome friends have suggested to me that it could be something similar to straight males liking lesbian porn - you get to read or write about two characters you like going at it without any women, who a large proportion of the fandom will not be attracted to, involved to get in the way. However, that still wouldn't explain why I like it, since I'm more attracted to other women than I am to men.\\n\\nIt could partly be the novelty of it - male/male sex and relationships are things that a woman cannot experience in real life so fanfiction could be a good way to explore these things if you're curious about them but don't want to do anything drastic.\\n\\nIn fandom for some animes/mangas/etc. it could also be partly due to the lack of interesting female characters; if the women aren't interesting in canon you're not going to find them interesting when you read about them in a fic, no matter what they're doing with each other or with the male characters.\\n\\nA male/male relationship could also seem more equal, and with a same-sex relationship a woman might feel like there was more freedom for the characters not to behave in the way they would be expected to if they were in a relationship with a female (if that makes sense). In a straight relationship there are roles which each person is kind of expected to take based on their sex (maybe not so much in real life, but in things like movies and TV shows), slash may make it easier for a woman to write about or imagine the characters in a relationship without using these roles.\n"

Isn't that the real problem? That most people have deeply felt beliefs and believe they are right, and have a hard time tolerating others with different views? Your opinion and decisions about religions, our origins, and so on are valid, but so are mine. You speak of religious people being narrow minded, and refer to people like yourself as broad-minded. But, isn't it narrow minded to label any one group of people? You are saying that you don't like having a religious person's views imposed on you. But, in the same breath, you impose your beliefs on us, and label \"anyone believing\" as unfulfilled, and unintelligent. How exactly does that make sense? Since the group you are speaking of (religious people) is a group I belong to, perhaps I should enlighten you by letting you know that I'm not imposing my beliefs on anyone. I'm am quite ready to talk to those who would listen or have questions, and I am quite ready to listen to others. Do I believe blindly and narrowly? Well, if I didn't believe 100% in my God, that would make me a hypocrite who is wasting my time. If that says to you that I am either blind or narrow, then so be it.

This may be for some or all classes.\\n\\nStudents who are mainstreamed are most often students with mild to moderate learning or emotional disabilities.  They will have an invoiivualized education plan (IEP) written by a team of people concerned about his/her educational progress.  That team generally incudes special education teacher, regular education teachers, specialists such as speech therapists, parents and representatives from any community service providing agencies.\\n\\nThe IEP will include modifications and accomodations that may be made within the general education setting to allow the student to thrive.  These may be as simple as untimed tests and seating near the teacher, to having the teacher wear a special sound ampligfication device, among others.\\n\\nDoes inclusion work?  Well, that depends on the school district's commitment to inclduing kids in the regular classroom, on the students (and parents') willingness to meet some general classroom expectations, and upon the skill of the classroom teacher.  If everyone works together and expects success, it generally happens.  If any member of the instructional team doubts the child's ability to succedd, it usually becomes a self-fulfilling prohecy, and the child may end up back in a separate special education setting. This special environment is viewed as being a more restictive environment, whereas the incluusion class is viewed as a less restrictive environment, as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\\n\\nMy third grader has surprised some naysayers and has been included in regular education for math and special subjects for two years now.

        "sentence": "Question: im trying to find a g force scale that can tell me what happens to a human if it goes up .?\nAnswer: From wikipedia:\\n\\nOne often hears the term being applied to the limits that the human body can withstand without losing conciousness, sometimes referred to as \"blacking out\", or g-loc (loc stands for loss of consciousness). A typical person can handle about 5 g (50 m/s²) before this occurs, but through the combination of special g-suits and efforts to strain muscles —both of which act to force blood back into the brain— modern pilots can typically handle 9 g (90 m/s²) sustained (for a period of time) or more. Resistance to \"negative\" or upward gees which drive blood to the head, is much less. This limit is typically in the -2 to -3 g (-20 to -30 m/s²) range. The vision goes red and is also referred to as a \"red-out\". This is probably due to capillaries in the eyes bursting under the increased blood pressure. Humans can survive about 20 to 40 g instantaneously (for a very short period of time). Any exposure to around 100 g or more, even if momentary, is likely to be lethal.\n"

He was probably wrong about that, see articles on dark energy to learn why. Since Energy is expressed in joules which is a measure of work - moving one newton of mass one meter-, a measurement in meters per second was needed for the energy equation to solve with the proper units. Einstein believed that the square of the speed of light would account for the most extreme accleration possible and therefore would produce the highest theoretical yield of energy. At least that's what a lot of scientists think Einstein thought.

The company sells alumni directors to schools all over the usa by telephone. People call us and we call people. Today I had some very frustrating calls. One of which the customer would not stop talking and I in return was very patient. The very next call I got frustrated with a customer and after I thought they had hung up I said sort of under my breathe \"*****\" well it turns out that the company recorded the call and heard me say that. Well I have a 90 day window where I am suppose to not screw up. Well when the manager listens to a message and hears me say ***** thats not good. He said he didnt know if the customer had hung up yet or not, but im about 99.9 % sure I would never say that to someones face. So tonight I had to go talk to him and he said I was suspended and they were gonna deliberate to see if the customer had hung up. I either will get fired or on a final notice. What should I do? I feel fucked\nAnswer: It sounds like you had a weak moment, but it was nothing intentional...If the customer heard you say *****, they would have likely called to complain about it immediately, and requested to speak to your superior.  It's more likely that they simply didn't hear you...I have to speak to clients on a daily basis; in person and over the phone.  You screwed up, but it's not the end all be all...This information might go into your personnel file (is the fact that someone \"may\" have heard you that much of a black mark, really?).  If by chance you are fired, all you can do is chalk it up to a lesson learned...Keep in mind also, if the client was verbally abusive, you should not have to tolerate it...Tell them so, and hang up.

I've tried re-installing it, but it still is not working.  Any other ideas.  Thank you\nAnswer: First, I'd recommend uninstalling your Messenger and downloading and installing the newest verson from Yahoo!  When you do this, though, you might have a corrupt file in your Yahoo! Messenger directory. To fix the problem, you must manually delete the \"Messenger\" directory on your C: drive (default), then reinstall the Yahoo! Messenger application.\\n\\nTo delete the directory:\\nClose the Yahoo! Messenger application if you currently have it running. Make sure all instances of Internet Explorer are closed. \\nGo to your desktop and double-click \"My Computer.\" \\nClick the \"C:\" drive. \\nGo to:\\nC:&#92;Program Files&#92;Yahoo!\\nHighlight the Yahoo! Messenger folder and press the Delete key on your keyboard. (All archives will be deleted if they are not copied. Please see below.)\\n\\nTo install:\\nClose all running applications except for your Internet browser.\\nVisit the Yahoo! Messenger home page.\\nClick the \"Download Now\" button.\\n\\nTo copy your complete Message Archive:\\nClose Yahoo! Messenger (if it is currently running). \\nGo to your Desktop and double-click \"My Computer.\" \\nSelect the \"C:\" drive. \\nGo to:\\nC:&#92;Program Files&#92;Yahoo!&#92;Messenger&#92;Profiles\\nYour \"Profiles\" folder contains your complete Message Archive. Copy it to the same location on another computer if you wish to view it elsewhere.\\n\\nNote: If you copy this folder to another computer, your complete Message Archive will be copied, overriding the Message Archive on the computer to which you are copying.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nAfter that, if you still have problems, make sure that you have the latest version of Macromedia's Flash Player installed, as Messenger uses certain Flash components on startup.  \\n\\nBeyond that, your Yahoo! Messenger connection information may be incorrect. Follow these steps to configure your connection:\\nClick the \"Messenger\" menu in Yahoo! Messenger and select \"Connection Preferences.\"\\nEnable the \"Firewall with no proxies\" option.\\nSelect the correct Internet connection type and country from the pull-down menus.\\nClick the \"OK\" button at the bottom of the window.\\nYahoo! Messenger will ask you if you want to sign in again with your new proxy settings. Click the \"OK\" button.\\nEnter your Yahoo! ID and password and click the \"Sign In\" button.\\n\\nThe above configuration works in most situations. (However, if you connect in this way, you won't be able to use the Voice feature.) If this configuration doesn't work, follow these steps:\\nClick the \"Messenger\" menu in Yahoo! Messenger and select \"Connection Preferences.\"\\nEnable the \"No network detection\" option and then click the \"OK\" button at the bottom of the window.\\nYahoo! Messenger will ask you if you want to sign in again with your new proxy settings. Click the \"OK\" button. \\nEnter your Yahoo! ID and password and click the \"Sign In\" button.\\n\\nIf neither of the above options work, you're probably behind a firewall or proxy server that requires you to enter its address. Follow these steps:\\nClick the \"Messenger\" menu in Yahoo! Messenger and select \"Connection Preferences.\"\\nEnable the \"Use proxies\" option. \\nEnter your firewall or proxy server's address and port number. Contact your network administrator (if you're at work), or your Internet service provider (if you're at home) to determine the correct firewall and proxy settings.\\nClick the \"OK\" button at the bottom of the window.\\nYahoo! Messenger will ask you if you want to sign in with your new proxy settings. Click the \"OK\" button.\\nEnter your Yahoo! ID and password and click the \"Sign In\" button. \\n------------------------------------------------------\\nIf you try all of the steps above and Yahoo! Messenger \n"

Timothy 2;12, I do not permit a Woman to teach or to have authority over a Man; she must be silent.\nAnswer: The testimonies of manhood and womenhood are often neglected by todays so called \"church\". Rarely do men know that males are supposed to be a living testimony of Christ. Just as rarely do women know that females are to be a living testimony of the redeemed Church of Christ. Such truth is portrayed in the indisputable writings of the Apostle Paul in Ephesians:\\n\\nEphesians 5:\\n21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.\\n22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.\\n23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.\\n24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.\\n25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;\\n26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,\\n27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.\\n28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.\\n29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:\\n30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.\\n\\nVerse 21 bluntly clearifies that we are to care for each other, and submit to the needs of one another. Paul further explains that the relationship of husband and wife is the same as that of Christ and His Church. Therefore, let the man love and take care of his wife as Christ does the Church, and let the wife honour and obey her husband as the Church does Christ.\\n\\nThis is an often neglected topic in today's modern teaching, because it isn't politically correct. However, Christ nor His Apostles were politically correct.  As Peter states:\\n\\nACTS 5:29 Then Peter and the [other] apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.\\n\\nPolitics, including feminism and political correctness have no place in the Church of Christ. No Apostle or early heads of the Church ever tried to update Christ's doctrine to the standards of Society. Think about it, you fools, if sinners are to define holiness, then who isn't holy? If sinners are to define sin, then who needs the sacrifice of Christ?\\n\\nAnd for those who think that Christians cannot correct, judge, or rebuke, why does the Spirit of Christ through Paul say otherwise?\\n\\n2TIMOTHY 3:16 All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:\n"
