I don't want to get stuck in a 6-month rental contract over this crap.\nAnswer: The VA does not normally make direct loans.  The loan is made by a bank or mortgage company.  They use their standard underwriting rules when qualifying you for the loan.  The VA only guarantees part of the loan.  This guarantee is usually sufficient to avoid having to provide a down payment.\\n\\nWhen I retired from the AF, I had a job offer in a different area 2 months before my last duty day.  It just takes work to do that, but it's entirely do-able.  I was able to get a mortgage based on my employment history and the new job committment.\\n\\nMost lenders like to see a stable employment history, typically 2 or more years in the same industry and 6 months in your current job.  You alread meet that test.  Many lenders specialize in working with military personnel.  Ideally, look for a credit union with military ties in your new location.  If they are satisfied that you are likely to find a position that provides sufficient income to pay the mortgage they may will take a chance on you.  At the very least, they will probably give you a conditional approval based on finding a job with adequate income.  You'll probably need to actually get the job before they'll fund a mortgage but at least the scut work will be done.\\n\\nIf you can't fnd a lender in advance and don't have a job prior to your ETS you'll have to rent at least temporarily.  Ask for a month-to-month contract as you're trying to buy a home.  Or ask for a clause in your lease that allows you to break the lease to move into a purchased home.  That's not unusual.  Not all landlords will do it but it doesn't hurt to ask.  I did that twice in my military career and one time the landlord agreed to add the clause AFTER I'd signed the lease.\\n\\nUnless you ask for what you want, the answer will automatically be \"No!\"  And if the first lender or landlord says, \"No!\" then look for another one.  Someone out there IS willing to work with you on this, you just need to ask around.\n"

Basically, you lift your arms and thrust your chest in and out repeatedly. These  exercises will not exactly change the size of your breasts. Breasts are largely fatty tissue, and there are no exercises to grow fat. However, the exercise  helps to build up the chest muscles directly below the breasts. This can push the breasts outward. Even though not enlarged, the fact that they will protrude more gives them the appearance of being a bit large.\\n\\nGiven the facts my advice is if you're just looking for a more appearance-altering technique, I recommend a well-padded bra. \\n\\nLast but not the least important is a personal reminder...

Do this with a lot of dribbles and then with as few as possible. Stay low! \\n\\n\\nDrum dribble \\nEither standing or on one knee have players dribble ball changing hands with each touch. Start with a steady dribble then work down to super fast low dribbles. then have them dribble with one finger on each hand and with their balled up fist. \\n\\nKeep your head up\\nWhen you dribble the ball, your intent is to go somewhere. Maybe you are dribbling up the court on a fast break, maybe you are dribbling to the wing as part of the offense, or maybe you are driving past the defender and to the basket. Whatever your goal and wherever you are going, you need to see the floor. Never dribble the ball with your head down, looking at the ball. By keeping your head up and seeing the floor, you can see where the defense is and what your next move might have to be. You can also see where your teammates are, who might be open, and what a good passing opportunity might be.\\n\\nThis is a great drill for getting used to dribbling with your head up so you can see the floor: simply start at one baseline and dribble full speed the full length of the court, keeping your head up at all times. DO NOT look down at the ball. Switch hands at half court. You can also try this drill with your eyes closed. But only dribble at half speed, and make sure to open your eyes after a few dribbles to make sure you aren't going to run into anything.\\n\\n\\nBe able to dribble with either hand\\nIf you can only dribble effectively with your strong hand, you are very limited as an offensive threat. If I'm a defender, and I know you can only dribble to your right side, it will be very easy to guard you. But if you can drive to either your right or left, and have a good outside shot, then you're a real threat. Then I have to guard against a shot, and a drive to either side. Now you've got me guessing about what you might do next. Work on dribbling with both hands so that you don't have a weak dribbling hand. Work at it enough that you can dribble and drive to the baset equally well with either hand.\\n\\nThere are two ways to build your off-hand dribbling skills: one is simply to practice with your off hand. Make a point to do ONLY off hand dribbling drills for 15 or 20 mins a day for the next week. You'll be amazed at how much better your off hand will be in just that short amount of time.\\n\\nAnother amazing set of drills for developing your off hand are two-ball drills. Get two basketballs and start off at the baseline. Dribble both balls in a zig-zag pattern for the full length of the court, bouncing the balls at the same time. Once you reach the other end of the floor, do the same drill, but this time bounce the balls at different times (one ball hits the ground as the other ball comes up to your other hand, etc.). Remember, don't look down at the balls as you dribble. Do these drills for a few weeks and your off hand dribbling ability will be much improved.\\n\\n\\nBALL SLAP DRILL \\nThe ball slap drill is performed by taking the ball and with your left hand slap the ball hard, and then taking your right hand and slap the ball hard. This ball slap drill is a good way to warm your hands up and this will help you get a good feel for the ball. Continue performing the slap the ball dribbling drill until your hands are good, awake, and ready to begin. \\n\\n\\nAROUND THE WORLD DRILL \\nBasketball Dribbling Drill #2: The around the world basketball drill stats by circling the ball around your head, than your waist, and finally put your legs together and take the ball around both legs at the knees. Then, bend at the waist, spread your legs, and circle the ball around one leg, then the other.

If you like Burgundy, but you are having an outdoor wedding then you should try a lighter hue and use your flowers and accessories to reflect your love of this color.\\n\\nThis is your wedding and the memories should last a lifetime. Remember this, no one can tell what time of year it was in 20 years and they are looking at your pictures. Congrats and have a wonderful life.\n"

(his name is John) (My best friend's name is Haley)\\nJohn Hates Haley. Haley is in luv wit him. I LOVE JOHN. and haley is going out with a boy she doesnt even like and shes doing that to make John jealous. She Thinks He Still likes her. Haley Thinks He is going out with me 2 make her jealous. ME and John are fine we love each other. But Haley, (my now x-best friend) likes him still. Me and John have been going out for a month and a week. And i dont want us 2 end. Please Give Me advice 2 get rid of Haley. (without any murder please) Give Me advice to help out please!\nAnswer: Wow.  Well, there is nothing you can really do to control the outcome of this situation, that depends on who truly has feelings for who.  I think John probably really likes you and not Haley, because if he still liked Haley he would probably be already trying to get back together with her by now.  I think Haley just wants to believe he still likes her because she likes him, and people can make themselves belief what they really want to believe.  \\n\\nIt is kind of disturbing that you would date your friend's ex especially when you know she still likes him.  Maybe you two aren't truly friends?  I guess you can just stop hanging out with Haley.  And she can't come between you and John if John truly likes you and not her, right?\\n\\nSo I guess just tell Haley that you think she is kind of obsessed with John, and John is with you now, and you are sorry but you really have feelings for John, so you think it's best if you and she don't hang out for awhile.  This will hurt her, but I guess she needs to get the message that John is taken now, and she needs to back off.\n"

The formal definition can be found here at wikipedia:\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return\\n\\nIt is simply a method used to compare different investment scenarios. As different alternatives may involve different sums of money paid at different points in time, it may be difficult to objectively compare them. The IRR simply produces a single number for each alternative, and the one with the highest IRR is chosen as the best one.\\n\\nWhat it basically measures is the amount of interest that a bank account would have to pay in order to attain the same cash payments.\\n\\nSome simple examples:\\n\\nFor instance, if you were to pay $100, and then receive $110 back 1 year later, the IRR is 10%.\\n\\nIf you were to pay $100, then receive $10 back one year later, and then $110 one year after that (two years after the beginning), then the IRR is still 10%.\\n\\nIn general, the IRR is difficult to solve, and must use iterative numerical methods for its solution.\\n\\nThere are also known problems with IRR that make its usefulness somewhat limited.\\n\\nLet's just say that you had a situation where you received $110 dollars now, and only had to pay $100 one year from now. If you work through the numbers, you would find the IRR to be -10% (note the MINUS).\\n\\nIf instead you received $100 now and had to pay back $100 one year from now, the IRR would be 0%.\\n\\nNow we can see the problem - clearly the first alternative is favourable, you receive more money UP FRONT than you even need to pay in. Unfortunately, IRR messes up in these kinds of cases and gives you a misleading result.\n"

This might seem like a pipe dream, but these are the answers thrown up by a Times-CNN poll conducted in four metros. \\n\\nThe optimism however is tempered by a feeling that the country’s infrastructure poses a challenge to its growth. The road ahead, many feel, is not so smooth, as structural and social issues could impede development. \\n\\nNearly 63 per cent respondents feel India’s infrastructure will ultimately prevent it from becoming a global economic power. The feeling is more strong among respondents in Mumbai (77 per cent) and Kolkata (67 per cent), two cities that are coping with the hard realities of poor infrastructure. \\n\\nAsked whether the current government was adequately addressing the rich-poor divide, 58 per cent respondents felt otherwise. Gautam Nath, executive VP, TNS India explains, \"Respondents feel the government has not addressed the rich/poor gap problem adequately. \\n\\nIn Mumbai, the feeling has grown after the recent floods, which explains why 77 per cent Mumbaikars felt so strongly about infrastructure being an impediment to growth. Concerns such as the hike in petroleum prices, power problems, water crisis and rising costs of basic utilities make them feel the government has not been active where it should be.\" \\n\\nOf the four metros, the level of disillusionment with the government is higher in the National Capital (62 per cent) and the financial capital of the country (61 per cent) as compared to Chennai and Kolkata. In Kolkata, only 52 per cent feel strongly against the government. Perhaps, the socialist government there which actively promotes socio-economic parity has something to do with this mindset. \\n\\nOn HIV/AIDS, 52 per cent of all respondents felt the government had not done enough. Natural, considering that officially there are over 5.1 million HIV positive cases in India; unofficial estimates put the figure at around 8.5 million. And the numbers are growing. \\n\\nOn whether Bollywood would surpass Hollywood as the entertainment capital of the world, there was a marked divide between two cities with the highest stake in the Hindi-centric industry. Delhi (54 per cent) and Mumbai (49 per cent) had more Bollywood supporters than Chennai and Kolkata with their own established Tamil and Bengali film industries. \\n\\nNath says, \"The results show that the government, usually known for its lack of proactiveness and slow start, needs to prioritise its processes and public image.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nThe poll, conducted by market research firm TNS, was done in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. Seventy-five per cent of the respondents feel India could be the next superpower. What’s more, 41 per cent felt Bollywood could one day surpass Hollywood. \\n\\nAlso, with India’s GDP rivalling that of China, its firm commitment to democracy and a rapidly-growing rich and middle class, India’s future superpower status is assured, they feel. Mumbaikars (84 per cent) are more optimistic about the future. Delhi (75 per cent), Chennai (70 per cent) and Kolkata (68 per cent) are not so gung-ho.\n"

Without sufficient atmospheric pressure, body fluids will start to heat up and boil. Without oxygen, we would be unable to breathe. \\nThe parts of a spacesuit\\n\\nSpacesuits serve many functions. Today's spacesuits are pressurized, have an oxygen supply, protect the astronaut from micrometeoroid bombardment while spacewalking, and insulate the astronaut from the severe temperature changes experienced in space. The Space Shuttle astronauts have more than one \"outfit\" for space travel. What they wear while on a mission is determined by the job they are doing. During the launch and re-entry, the astronauts wear a partially pressurized suit and a parachute pack. The suit has a helmet, gloves, and boots which all serve as protection for the astronaut. Within the suit are bladders that automatically fill with air at reduced cabin pressures. At low pressure, the blood will pool in the lower body causing the astronaut to black out. The bladders maintain the pressure on the lower body to prevent this from happening. While working in the Shuttle during orbit, astronauts work in comfortable clothes such as knit shirts, pants, or flight suits. In addition, prior to each mission, flight crews are outfitted with lined jackets, sleep shorts, slippers, and underwear. \\nWhile working outside of the Shuttle during a mission, astronauts wear an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU). This suit has interchangeable parts so it can be assembled to fit different astronauts. This makes the suit more cost effective since it can be reused. The EMU has a liquid cooling garment, which is a one piece suit made of spandex, and keeps the astronaut cool while in the suit. The unit also contains headphones and microphones, a drink bag which carries water, a life support system containing oxygen, and a urine collection device. Gloves are included with the unit along with a helmet and a visor. All of this is necessary to protect the astronaut from micrometeoroids, solar radiation, infrared radiation, temperature changes, pressure changes, and oxygen deprivation.\n"

Only to gain back plus more.  This has worked well for me.  Check it out it can't hurt.  The big thing is you have to be willing and ready to work at it.  I did not do special exercising but am going to start now that I'm almost at my goal from a size 18-20 to a size 7/8\n"

        "sentence": "Title: greek army what did they do, how did they fight, what did they fight with in the old days?\nQuestion: how did they fight, what did they use, what patterns did they stand in\nAnswer: Warfare in Ancient Greece centered mainly around heavy infantrymen called hoplites. The word hoplite (Greek ὁπλίτης, hoplitēs) derives from hoplon (ὅπλον, plural hopla, ὅπλα) meaning an item of armour or equiment and consequently the entire equipment of the hoplite (but not specifically the circular shield, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a hoplon, though it was in fact called an aspis). These soldiers probably first appeared in the late 8th century BC. These were a citizen-militia, and so were armed as spearmen, which are relatively easy to equip and maintain; mainly they represented the middle class, who could afford the cost of the armaments. Almost all the famous men of ancient Greece, even the philosophers and playwrights, fought as hoplites at some point in their lives.\\n\\nHow did they fight?\\nSince the hoplites were a militia force and did not receive permanent wages, campaigns were short and mainly confined to the summer. Armies marched directly to their target. There the defenders could hide behind city walls, in which case the attackers generally had to content themselves with ravaging the countryside as siegecraft was undeveloped, or meet them on the field. Battles were usually set piece and intended to be decisive. Both forces lined up on a level field, usually in a rough phalanx formation around eight ranks deep (though this varied). Other troops were less important; cavalry generally protected the flanks, when present at all, and both light infantry and missile troops were negligible.\\n\\nWith what did they fight?\\nHoplites generally armed themselves immediately before battle, since the equipment was so heavy. Each man provided his own gear so it was fairly non-uniform, and often friendly troops would fail to recognise one another. A hoplite typically had a breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well as greaves and other armor, plus a bowl-shaped wooden shield called an aspis which was around 1 metre across. The primary weapon was a spear, around 2.7 metres in length; as this frequently broke upon charging and was unwieldy for close combat, hoplites also carried a smaller 60 cm thrusting sword called a xiphos. The total cost of the hoplon was roughly equivalent to a middle-sized car in our time.\n"

You don't see a guy kissing another guy as a good bye.  Sharing the secrets is quite unpopular to men.  This shows that society can change in any way, whether that is to bisexual or gay society.  The women are less conspicious because the society has gotten used to such things as hugging kissing etc, but for man it is very weak to show such things.\n"

Many physical phenomena, including fluid flow, heat transport, and diffusion can be described by appropriate partial differential equations.  In order to solve these equations and make predictions, you need to be good at calculus.\\n\\nIf you limit yourself to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you would be stuck with linear models for everything.  This means that any more complicated relationship between two variables could not be modeled continuously, and you would never be able to extrapolate with any confidence.  Thus development of new technology would be strictly trial and error (and you wouldn't even have a good trial and error system without statistics).\\n\\nHang in there!  Get through that math.  You don't have to like it, but you will inevitably appreciate the developments that math has enabled.\n"
