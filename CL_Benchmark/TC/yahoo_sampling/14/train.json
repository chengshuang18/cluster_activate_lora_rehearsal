There is no actual proof of god he is a belief shared by a majority of people. Every person is different. Some experience miracles and others witness murders and rapes and it is those things that lead people to not believe that god does all good things. When you live in the United States and you hear this crap about we're the most powerful nation in the world and all that, well why cant we feed our own people. I see poor people on the street every day so how has god done them good. How has god done good for those children in Africa who are starving to death before they are 4 years old. Or what about those children who see their parents be killed by a terrorist attack and have to live with a foster family because the leaders of our country are trying to benefit themselves, how has god done them good. Its all a bunch of crap the president doesnt want to benefit this country hes trying to benefi himself and gain more power so he can get more money and continue to expose the United States, but thats another issue. For those people it seems God has done nothing for them. I grew up religious but as i mature and as i see how things unroll in life i question gods purpose. And for sweetie up there ^, you cant teach religion in public schools. Remember? thats how America is so great. Freedom of religion. we're all free to believe what we want and we're still trying to force this god bullcrap on everyone. People in todays society are all greedy they care about themselves and themselves only. Why does it matter to you if other peopel dont believe in god. It's all crap and god has done nothing for many people but i guess since ur all probably upper class white people u dont see the reality. Exactly why this country is hated across the world. PEOPLE TRYING TO FORCE RELGION ON OTHERS.\n"

Wait for the lame beginning to pass, then click on music types like house, trance, trance, and for people who like hip hop, you'd probably like drum n' bass or breaks.:\\nhttp://www.di.fm/edmguide/edmguide.html\\n\\nNOTE: the type of \"techno\" that the general public usually hears, is eurodance or happy hardcore. If you want fast techno, but not lame techno, trancecore or acid trance may be more in your liking. Ambient house for those of you that feel the need to completely chillout, but trance is great for that too. Want to hear some really wierd \"dark\" beats? That'd be goa-psy trance. And finally, the worst techno in the ENTIRE world: gabber. Don't even try listening to that. The type of music that is usually played in classy bars: house or progressive.\\n\\nWant to hear radio stations that are easy to access, with techno of all types? go here: \\nhttp://www.di.fm\\n\\nGood luck!\nAnswer: The generalized belief behind Techno/Trance is that to people who don't listen to that type of music label it as Techno/Trance in general, regardless of the obvious different beats and styles. The same thing goes for other genres. People who don't listen to Hip-Hop/Rap, Rock, Metal, Pop, Pop-Rock, etc. may label them into the same category, whereas their different styles and beats obviously place them in completely different categories. Thus came about the belief amongst several that Techno/Trance sucks because they once listened to Ambient House and wasn't in the mood to chill or heard Acid Trance but wanted to fall asleep.\\n\\nMany views are based upon one sided facts.\n"

But there is hope. Internet radio is gaining popularity daily with the general public partly because listeners know they can listen to independent artists that commercial radio refuses to play.

Anyone believing blindly & narrowly in their religion is not living a fulfilled life and generally annoy the broader-minded population by their short-term & borrowed ideologies which some try to impose on others.\\n\\nIn this era, I tend to laugh (silently) when someone says \"The word of God says this or that...\" or \"Jesus says that we should do or that we shouldn't do this or that...\"\\n\\nJust read the news (about Judas' Gospel) and read books similar to the Da Vinci Code.

Isn't that the real problem? That most people have deeply felt beliefs and believe they are right, and have a hard time tolerating others with different views? Your opinion and decisions about religions, our origins, and so on are valid, but so are mine. You speak of religious people being narrow minded, and refer to people like yourself as broad-minded. But, isn't it narrow minded to label any one group of people? You are saying that you don't like having a religious person's views imposed on you. But, in the same breath, you impose your beliefs on us, and label \"anyone believing\" as unfulfilled, and unintelligent. How exactly does that make sense? Since the group you are speaking of (religious people) is a group I belong to, perhaps I should enlighten you by letting you know that I'm not imposing my beliefs on anyone. I'm am quite ready to talk to those who would listen or have questions, and I am quite ready to listen to others. Do I believe blindly and narrowly? Well, if I didn't believe 100% in my God, that would make me a hypocrite who is wasting my time. If that says to you that I am either blind or narrow, then so be it. But you might consider that our time on earth may be better spent discussing issues without judgment - oh, but wait, Jesus told us not to judge, so I guess that won't work, huh?\n"

Hosting a web application shouldn't be that difficult.

If a mole is changing color or shape or it's smaller than a pencil eraser diameter and getting bigger, it should be examined by a dermatologist.

In a buyer's market where there are multiple goods on sale from a variety of retailers then you could wander around until you found the article that you want at the cheapest price or even barter if retailers are desperate for business due to competition.\\n\\nHowever the saying is not derived from this.

Thus making the choice is your decision provided that you accept, when making that choice, that there may be repercussions at some future time from taking that path.\\n\\nAn example could be deciding to drop out of college to take a job as, say, a shop assistant. In the short term you may think that it's a good choice because you suddenly have money to spend and, to your friends, an increase in status due to you working rather than going to college. However some way down the line when they have all graduated and got better jobs than you it becomes apparent that you may have made a wrong decision since they will now earn more than you and have a higher status.

        "sentence": "Question: Why does the ozone layer deplete?\nAnswer: Ozone destruction\\n\\nChemical factors\\nOzone can be destroyed by a number of free radical catalysts, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), \\nnitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). All of these radicals have both natural and anthropogenic (manmade) sources. At the present time, most of the OH and NO in the stratosphere is of natural origin, but human activity has dramatically increased the chlorine and bromine. These elements are found in certain stable compounds, especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which may find their way to the stratosphere and there be liberated by the action of ultraviolet light. Most importantly, the chlorine atoms so generated destroy ozone molecules in a catalytic cycle. In this cycle, a chlorine atom reacts with an ozone molecule, taking an oxygen atom with it (forming ClO) and leaving a normal oxygen molecule. A free oxygen atom then takes away the oxygen from the ClO, and the final result is an oxygen molecule and a chlorine atom, which then reinitiates the cycle. A single chlorine atom would keep on destroying ozone forever were it not for reactions that remove them from this cycle by forming reservoir species such as hydrochloric acid and chlorine nitrate. On a per atom basis, bromine is even more efficient than chlorine at destroying ozone, but there is much less bromine in the atmosphere at present. As a result, both chlorine and bromine contribute significantly to the overall ozone depletion.\\n\\nPolar stratospheric clouds\\nThe reactivation of atomic chlorine from these reservoir species is normally slow, but is enhanced by the presence of polar stratospheric clouds which appear during Antarctic winters, leading to a strong seasonal cycle in ozone hole formation.\\n\\nFor more info go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion\n"

        "sentence": "Question: Why does the meter disk will turn?\nAnswer: The meter must measure the power you use (and must pay for) using the formula P = IE (power equals current (I) times voltage (E)).  To do so it must accurately dedect the line voltage and electrical current entering your house.  The meter contains an aluminum disk that you can see spinning fast or slow depending upon how many (or few) electrical devices you have turned on.  Inside the meter there are two coils of wire (one on top and one on the bottom of the disk).  One coil senses instaneous voltage that can vary (and even droop in a brownout).  The other coil detects all the current you are using, if any.  With your main circuit breaker open there will be none.  When there is both voltage and current flowing, magnetic eddies are produced that measure and integrate the power being used by spinning the aluminum disk (like a small motor) which is connected to a set of gears that turn the meter numerals.  See the link for an illustration and detailed explanation.  Good luck.\n"

Now I understand that non smokers would like smoke free places but I dont know any non smokers who wont go into restaurants with a \"smoking section\". I find this very infair and unconstitutional since there was never a time when a buisiness owner couldn't put up a \"no smoking\" sign. This will damage most businesses in NJ gaurenteed. Where could I help speak against this issue and can I find others who feel our civil liberties being stripped from us?\nAnswer: Hi, I live in Georgia and we are already \"smoke free\". We cant smoke in any public building. This means, as you said, restaurants, bars, etc. We aren't allowed to take a lit cigarette in grocery stores, laundry mats or any convient store. Also our work force here is the carpet industry, and most carpet mills run 24 hours, 7 days a week. Alot run swing shifts, which consist of working 12 hour shifts. Now even our mills are saying \"no smoking\" on their property, not even in your own vehicle. If observed doing this you will be terminated. And I'm not even really sure when the voting of these laws were. So I too, would like speak against this issue. I understand non-smokers have rights, but doesn't smokers have any rights at all?\n"

So if  you could tell me everything you know about WHATEVER kind of Mythology, i would appriciate it alot. I cant go to anywhere but yahoo, so please dont give me references. Thank you!\\n\\n\\nI would like as many people as possible to answer this question, no matter if someone else already answered something that you know about as well. There are many different versions!\nAnswer: Here is what I found on Egyptian mythology\\nGods\\nEarly beliefs can be split into 5 distinct localized groups,\\n\\nthe Ennead of Heliopolis, whose chief god was Atum \\nthe Ogdoad of Hermopolis, where the chief god was Ra \\nthe Chnum-Satet-Anuket triad of Elephantine, where the chief god was Chnum \\nthe Amun-Mut-Chons triad of Thebes, where the chief god was Amun \\nthe Ptah-Sekhmet-Nefertem triad of Memphis, unusual in that the gods were unconnected before the triad was formalized, where the chief god was Ptah \\nThroughout the vast and complex history of Egypt, the dominant beliefs of the ancient Egyptians merged and mutated as leaders of different groups gained power. This process continued even after the end of the Egyptian civilization as we know it today. As an example, during the New Kingdom Ra and Amun became Amun-Ra. This \"merging\" into a single god is typically referred to as syncretism. Syncretism should be distinguished from mere groupings, also referred to as \"families\" such as Amun, Mut and Khonsu, where no \"merging\" takes place. Over time, deities took part in multiple syncretic relationships, for instance, the combination of Ra and Horus into Ra-Herakty. However, even when taking part in such a syncretic relationship, the original deities did not become completely \"absorbed\" into the combined deity, although the individuality of the one was often greatly weakened. Also, these syncretic relationships sometimes involved more than just two deities, for instance, Ptah, Seker and Osiris, becoming Ptah-Seker-Osiris. The goddesses followed a similar pattern. Also important to keep in mind is that sometimes the attributes of one deity got closely associated with another, without any \"formal\" syncretism taking place. For instance, the loose association of Hathor with Isis.\\n\\nAn interesting aspect of ancient Egyptian religion is that deities sometimes played different conflicting roles. As an example, the lioness Sekhmet being sent out by Ra to devour the humans for having rebelled against him, but later on becoming a fierce protectress of the kingdom, life in general and the sick. Even more complex is the roles of Set. Judging the mythology of Set from a modern perspective, especially the mythology surrounding Set's relationship with Osiris, it is easy to cast Set as the arch villain and source of evil. This is wrong, however, as Set was earlier playing the role of destroyer of Apep, in the service of Ra on his barge, and thus serving to uphold Ma'at (Truth, Justice and Harmony).\\n\\nGiven the diverse tapestry of religious history in ancient Egypt, it comes as no surprise that many different forms of theism evolved. Although mainly henotheistic in nature, at some point even monotheism, as introduced by Akhenaten thrived. What is important to realize is that it is very dangerous to try and cast the religion of the ancient Egyptians in any particular theistic form. Even more dangerous to claim is that, towards the end of the Egyptian civilization, a drive toward monotheism was taking place. The evidence of the time (Greaco-Roman period) seems counter to this belief: although syncretism was still taking place (sometimes and more frequently between Egyptian and non-Egyptian deities), many deities were still revered and served. As an example the following which Thoth enjoyed during these later periods. This is quite evident when one simply looks at the vast number of mummified Ibis birds offered to him. Also, the belief in Egyptian deities were spreading to countries other than Egypt. For instance the Roman belief in, and following of Isis.\\n\\nThe Egyptians believed that in the beginning, the universe was filled with the dark waters of chaos. The first god, Re-Atum, appeared from the water as the land of Egypt appears every year out of the flood waters of the Nile. Re-Atum spat and out of the spittle came out the gods Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture). The world was created\n"

Have a gameplan that you feel okay with and let the conversation just flow from there. \\n\\nAlso, positive thinking, quit telling yourself you are bad at one on one conversations. Tell yourself you are improving at them.

(who said, when, what's the significance within the scope of the text and in life as you know it). \"Okay, I'm going to pick three quotations from these chapters that a) are important to the narrative, or just good advice, and b) contain an obvious clue to the speaker/scene, hmm ... \"\nAnswer: 1. Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns\\ndriven time and again off course, once he had plundered\\nthe hallowed heights of Troy.\\nMany cities of men he saw and learned their minds,\\nmany pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,\\nfighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.\\nBut he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove—\\nthe recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all,\\nthe blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun\\nand the Sungod blotted out the day of their return.\\nLaunch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,\\nstart from where you will—sing for our time too.\\n\\n\\nmeaning:With these words the Odyssey begins. The poet asks for inspiration from the Muse and imagines her singing through him. An ancient epic poem states at the outset, in capsule form, the subject of the work to follow, and this epic is no exception. The Odyssey announces its subject matter in a different fashion from the Iliad. Whereas Homer’s first epic treats Achilles’ rage, this one focuses on a “man of twists and turns.” It chronicles not battles, the stuff of Achilles’ brief life, but a long journey through “[m]any cities” and “many pains,” the kind of test worthy of a resourceful hero like Odysseus. The opening lines foreshadow how the epic will end—with all of Odysseus’s men dead except Odysseus himself—and provide a reason for these deaths: the recklessness and blindness of his crew , who do not realize that by slaughtering the Sun’s cattle they seal their own dooms. The opening leaves unmentioned many other temptations the Achaeans will face and says nothing of the situation in Ithaca, which consumes nearly half the epic. It treats the subject matter of the epic in an abbreviated form but captures the themes those subjects will explore. As Knox notes in the introduction to the Fagles translation, in the Odyssey, in contrast to the Iliad, the Muse is asked to choose where to begin. Giving the Muse this freedom prepares us for the more complex narrative structure of the Odyssey, which relies on flashbacks as it moves through the many settings of the hero’s ten-year journey.\\n\\n\\n2.Of all that breathes and crawls across the earth,\\nour mother earth breeds nothing feebler than a man.\\nSo long as the gods grant him power, spring in his knees,\\nhe thinks he will never suffer affliction down the years.\\nBut then, when the happy gods bring on the long hard times,\\nbear them he must, against his will, and steel his heart.\\nOur lives, our mood and mind as we pass across the earth,\\nturn as the days turn . . .\\n\\nmeaning-Odysseus utters these words to the suitor Amphinomus shortly after defeating the “Beggar-King” Irus in Book 18 (18.150–157). Odysseus is himself in disguise as beggar, and his words here help maintain that cover. According to the story he has told, he once was a great warrior, plundering faraway lands, until one day he was captured. On one level, his words here reinforce those lies. The fatalism and helplessness he expresses—that a man only prospers while “the gods grant him power”—were frequently expressed sentiments of the Ancient Greek outlook, but they seem especially natural coming from a onetime king who has descended to the status of a beggar. Who better to comment on life’s reversals than someone who has experienced them firsthand?\\nThe words have additional meaning, however, for both Amphinomus and Odysseus. For Amphinomus, they foreshadow death. He is plundering the land of others, living a careless life, much as the beggar once did, but he too is a feeble man, and he is destined for a fall. The words are a prophecy to Amphinomus, and a warning; he does not miss their meaning, as he walks away “fraught with grave forebodings” (18.176). For Odysseus, on the other hand, the words do not foretell the future but recount the past and, perhaps, explain the lesson it has taught him. At the hour of his greatest triumph, the beginn\n"

        "sentence": "Question: What causes a yeast infection and how do you stop it from itching so much??\nAnswer: Basically, a yeast infection is caused when there is a build up of yeast in the system. This happens a lot to people who have an excess of Candida Albicans in the system (caused by eating too much refined sugar and white flour and not enough whole foods, fruits and vegetables), and can also happen from a buildup of bacteria locally. If you wear the same underwear for too long, or wear a wet bathing suit for longer than half a day, it can happen quite easily. Some women get minor Yeast infections every month right before their period, and the period usually resolves the infection. They're normal, you just have to make sure you see a doctor if you get them TOO regularly, because this could mean you have an auntoimmune disorder you're unaware of. Also, you want to go to a doctor the first time you think you have one so he or she can make sure it's not something else; a lot of Sexually Transmited Infections can mimic Yeast Infections, as can Vaginitis and Bacterial Infections. It's best to check with your doctor, but if you already have and are looking for a good anti-itch remedy, put some plain yogurt on the itchy areas and the 'good' pro-biotic bacteria in the yogurt will fight the 'bad' bacteria, helping to soothe the itch and reinforce the good bacteria.\n"

I also have a family to support. can they not judge me based on merits?\nAnswer: I feel for you, i have just been cleared of Hep B, when i got it the hospital were so unhelpful, they acted like it was all my fault and i deserved what i got (one nurse in perticular commented how i should'nt sleep about!!!). In truth, 3 years down the line i still dont know how or where i contracted it. when i got home i felt like a leper but my family were on hand for me giving me support and researching on the internet for me (even to the point of being vaccinated for me/against me) Are you in the US? is should be illegal for them to discriminate againt you on those grounds, you need to talk to a lawyer. Best of wishes and good health for the future.\n"

You have incredible insights and ability to drill down to the nuances most anyone would miss. I knew you were special...this example just continues to reveal that fact. Yet I am still astonished and even swept away by the depth of feedback you have given me. That you care enough to even take the time, the kind effort & thought, is impressive. But the ability you possess for finding a subjective meaning, is brilliant.\\n \\nI've had to read your reply several times, just to take it all in. Some points you make I might disagree with initially, but actually you're probably right even if I don't want to admit it. I don't see myself as complex enough, emotionally, to have \"innermost\" feelings of any kind. Whether it is fear, as you state-- or simply the fact I am a \"loner,\" there is a major tendency on my part to avoid emotions and personal connections. You haven't taken it as a personal insult that I am like this, although you easily could have started finding fault in response if you were a different kind of person.

If there was low friction, the rope would slide out, or you would have to hold it very very tightly, and this would increase the effort.\\n\\nAs between the pulley and the rope, there is very little friction and exactly this reduces the effort. If the friction was high (e.g. if the pulley was stuck), the required effort would have been higher.\\n\\nIf you're interested in how the wheel reduces friction, it is simple. Say you need to pull something by many meters. If there was no wheel, you would have many meters of high friction movement. If you have a wheel with a circumference of 1m, and its axis has a circumference of 1cm, then for each rotation of the wheel (1m) only the axis slides against the wheel by 1cm. The slide distance is 100 times lower. That's even not accounting for sleeve bearings (reducing friction of the axis). Or, even better, ball bearings.\n"

A DNA molecule refers to just a double stranded molecule but a chromosome is a condensed form of DNA complexed with proteins. An intermediate is the chromatin which is a network of fibrils consisting of DNA and they exist when the cell is not dividing.\\n\\n2. Prokaryotes have a single chromosme that contains only few proteins and appear as an electron-dense irregular shaped region called the nucleoid which is not enclosed by membrane. If you stretched this out, the chromosome would be a circular loop attached to the plasma membrane of the cell. Also, when they replicate, the replication occurs in two directions at once since the DNA molecule is cirular. Eukaryotes have much more proteins and when not being replicated are in the membrane bound nucleas as chromatin. Then the DNA replicates, it is dones by numerous origins of replication initially called replication bubbles that meet up to form replication forks. The broken segments of this replication method is calked Okazaki framents.\\n\\n3.Autosomal chromosomes are the rest of the chromosomes that are nonsex and are the same no matter what sex the person is. For example, there are 46 chromosomes in humans and one PAIR is your sex chromosome which determine your sex (girl = XX and boy = XY) while the other 44 are autosomal which you inherited no matter what your sex was.\\n\\n4. The word \"complexity\" is hard to define here because it is ambiguous and subjective. To us humans, a zebra may seem less complex since we cant tell them appart, but from the zebra's prospective, their unique stripe patterns differntiate very clearly who is who. At birth, the mother zebra spends 20 min. with its calf so it can memorize stripe patterns. However, understand the aim of the question, the answer is no. There is no proven evidence that shows a direct correlation of chromosome number to complexity. Well, you may think that since there are more chromosomes, these organisms have more alleles coded for them and are thus more complex. Not necessarily true. Some genes code for mutliple traits while others may have multiple genes for one trait. Also the vast number of genes that are coded in a single chromosome is very high. Ex. A Human has 46 chromosomes but a Crayfish has 200! Therefore more chromosomes do not mean higher \"complexity\" (at least in this implied definition)\n"

It's more likely that they simply didn't hear you...I have to speak to clients on a daily basis; in person and over the phone.  You screwed up, but it's not the end all be all...This information might go into your personnel file (is the fact that someone \"may\" have heard you that much of a black mark, really?).  If by chance you are fired, all you can do is chalk it up to a lesson learned...Keep in mind also, if the client was verbally abusive, you should not have to tolerate it...Tell them so, and hang up.  Good luck :)\n"

        "sentence": "Question: Why is hot air lighter than cold air?\nAnswer: Hot air is less dense than cold air, assuming that volume is held constant, because the molecules in the heated air move more and faster than in cold air.  Think about a room filled with people.  If the people move around quickly (as molecules in heated air), then the people will spread out more and make more room between eachother (which would be lower density).  Since the hot air is less dense, and more dense objects are \"more affected\" by gravity, then the warm air is \"lighter\".\n"

Reserve pay is dependent upon the number of drills you take part in.  If you are making 30k a year, you would have to be at least the rank of Sergeant (E-5) and have spent 8 years or more in the service.

Any recommendations in Atlanta (actually Norcross)?\nQuestion: I tried DSL a few years ago but switched to cable because the connection kept going down every night. Earthlink was my ISP but on Bell South's lines, which evidently were unstable. Is the situation better now and which ISP is cheap, reliable, with good spam controls, etc.?\nAnswer: We just switched back to bellsouth from Comcast. We had the same problems with bellsouth. Comcast was good but we decided to give Bellsouth a try again as they are offering cheaper prices. So far, so good. The bad weather we had about a month and a half ago (tornadoes and higwinds) it didnt efect our internet from bellsouth. The price is cheaper is the quality is just as good if not better than comcast.We are in Woodstock so we are not too far from you.\n"
