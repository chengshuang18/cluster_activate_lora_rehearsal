You should be extra careful with details in those marketing materials, NO typos, no false statements, try to be as accurate as possible and, of course, try to have those materials in at least two languages. Also be ready with quotation templates and check the payment method best suits you. again trust is important in this regard.\\n\\nIn this stage you may find in statistics about export of your country (given in any Economy Ministery website) about top foreign countries that most likely buy the kind of products you choose to sell from your location, keep it simple but be persistent as it takes a lot of work to get the first order, however, once you start, yopu will be in one of the most lucratives activities of the world and prosper you, as well as your family.\\n\\nAs you don´t give further details in your question I assume that you are starting from scratch, so, don´t worry, try to strenght relations with your friends and family, and the friends of your friends and the family of your family, try to find in your personal network those fellows that may help you connect the chain (find the best provider or find the first client) in any case prepare your selling speech for each case and be ready to show leadership and motivation, remember that doing business is a human activity and in involves inter-personal relationship skills.\\n\\nAlso, remember to keep it simple, export follows the same principle of local selling, you buy as cheap as possible and sell as expensive as possible (your profit will be the difference)\\n\\nbuy cheap and sell expensive (but be fair in both sides)\\n\\nDon´t kill the gold eggs chicken by trying to get all the eggs at once, keep you baance and try to not be so greedy.\\n\\nBeware of international scams!.

I was invited to play and was wondering how much padding to wear.\nAnswer: It depends on the person and how cold it is outside and how fast the guns is shooting. I usually wear jeans and a long sleeve shirt mostly with a t-shirt underneath. Sometimes i will double up long sleeve shirts or wear long underwear underneath one if it is really cold. The only way i get more padding is to wear long underwear legs. I don't recommend especially the first time going with just a t-shirt and bear arms, you will bruise and have welts all over. Make sure to conserve ammo and shoot at the effective range. Later on you can look into better face masks and neck protection, I don't know about cleats, I play in the desert/woods and so I wear boots. They do make a chest pad thing that is hard plastic which protects you and makes the balls break better. But you might be called a sissy. Don't wear too much padding as the balls will not break. Then they will all get mad at you and call you a sissy. Have Fun and don't take off your mask utnil the match is over and guns are on safe!!!!\n"

Can some one explain how allopatric speciation differs from sympatric speciation, and give examples of each? And how are the concepts of gradualism and punctuated equilibrium different, and how are they similar?\\n\\nThanks for the help! Biology has proven to be a little out of my realm of comprehension.\nAnswer: The difference betwen allopatric and sympatric is easy to remember: allopatric is geographical, sympatric is non-geographical.  \\n\\nAllopatric speciation involves a geographical separation (like a river, a mountain, a drought, separation following a migration, etc.)  Two subpopulations of a species get isolated from each other and evolve separately.  If this isolation is long enough, the two subspecies will first lose the desire, and then the ability to interbreed ... hence speciation.   This is believed to be the most common form of speciation in animals.\\n\\nSympatric speciation involves no geographical barrier, the two subspecies share territory.  One way that could happen is if there are two niches (like two types of food) in the same territory .... if some members prefer (or are slightly better adapted) for one food and others prefer the other food, then each will tend to meet and mate more with others of the same preference.  Thus any difference in adaptation between the two subspecies will get amplified, and the two may show less desire, and eventually an inability, to interbreed.  This is considered very rare in the animal kingdom except for insects, but may be more common in plants.  An example commonly given is the apple maggot (a kind of fly).\\n\\n(See source 1 for a better description.)\\n\\nPunctuated equilibrium is a theory developed by Niles Elderedge and my favorite science writer, Stephen Jay Gould.  It is the view that species often go through long periods of relative stability (equilibrium) that is broken up (punctuated) by periods of relatively fast change.  (See source 2 for a great illustration of how it works.)\\n\\nContrast this with gradualism, which holds that evolutionary change happens at a steady pace. \\n\\nThey are similar in that they both hold that evolution is a slow process ... in fact, it is a common misconception that they are opposites, when in fact punctuated equilibrium is a form of gradualism because it still holds that evolution is a long gradual process.  (See source 3)\\n\\nIn other words the opposite of gradualism is not punctuated equilibrium, it is something called 'catastrophism', where change occurs as a result of short-lived violent events (catastrophes).  Few scientists today are catastrophists. \\n\\nFeel free to email me if any of this is unclear.\n"

He may give you an oral med to take.  Or if you prefer over-the-counter treatments like vaginal suppositories/creams, you can clear it up in a few days. There are a couple of different kinds; if one ingredient doesn't work, try a different one.  Also over-the-counter cortisone cream will relieve the itch. Stay clear of sweets, white \"carbs\" like bread and pasta, eat yogurt with acidophalus cultures included (kills yeast) or take the over-the-counter acidophalus capsules.  Wear natural-fiber, loose fitting clothing and cotton panties/bras.  You want to keep the areas as dry as possible.  You can apply cornstarch to soothe and dry the areas also.  Don't use harsh soaps; try a bath in tipid water with 1/2 cup of oatmeal in a wash cloth tied with a rubberband.  It's a great gentle cleanser and won't irritate your delicate skin.

My daughter has biblical beleifs towards evolution and this boy just wasnt buying it. But he was opened to what she had to say. Everything she shared with him, he had an opposite response to. he kept asking her to \"please convince me. i want to believe\"  So my daughter came to me for advice, and im at a loss.\nAnswer: I will have to support Evolution! Let me give you a definition of Evolution!\\nBiological evolution, simply put, is descent with modification. This definition encompasses small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a population from one generation to the next) and large-scale evolution (the descent of different species from a common ancestor over many generations).\\nDocumentation of ancestor-descendant relationships among organisms also comes from the fields of biogeography, taxonomy, anatomy, embryology and, most recently, genetics — particularly DNA analysis.\\nThe fossil record remains first and foremost among the databases that document changes in past life on Earth. Fossils provide the dimension of time to the study of life. Some of the most basic observations about fossils and the rock record were made long before Darwin formulated his theory of “descent with modification.” The fossil record clearly shows changes in life through almost any sequence of sedimentary rock layers. Successive rock layers contain different groups or assemblages of fossil species.\\n{We have now more than enough fossils to determine for sure that humans didn’t appear on this planet in the genetic form they are today!\\nWE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST ANOTHER SPECIES WHICH LIVED WITH US!! And I am talking about Neanderthal man who was not our ancestor but a different Human than us!!! (Did God experiment with human species?) We even have proof that at a certain point in time 3 human species shared the planet! (Homo sapiens, Homo Erectus, Homo Neanderthals)}\\nOf course I want comment the stupid argument why all the apes didn’t evolve to humans. Ok I will comment!!\\n(We share a recent common ancestor with chimpanzees and gorillas; we have many anatomical, genetic, biochemical, and even behavioral similarities with these African great apes. We are less similar to the Asian apes--orangutans and gibbons--and even less similar to monkeys, because we share common ancestors with these groups in the more distant past. \\n! By the way why God decided to create 5 different species of primates and 280 different species of monkeys?)\\nAs a conclusion Evolution is not a theory but a proven fact (In scientific terms, \"theory\" does not mean \"guess\" or \"hunch\" as it does in everyday usage. Scientific theories are explanations of natural phenomena built up logically from testable observations and hypotheses. Biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the enormous range of observations about the living world.) Creation is a Hebrew Myth and unfortunately is not a fact but a myth!!!!\n"

        "sentence": "Question: Do these \"diets\" really work? Like Slimquick and any others you can think of.?\nAnswer: Any diet will work, keep in mind the following before choosing your next diet:\\n\\nDiets and changing your eating to healthy food choices can work but because we know so little about ourselves and our relationship with food, it makes it difficult to win the battle. A lot of us have problems with dieting because we have a problem called \"emotional eating\" we eat to comfort ourselves during difficult, stressful, sad, etc times in our lives.\\n\\nYou may experience all those emotions during dieting as we continuously get on the scale hoping to see a big difference in numbers after dieting only for a day or two. Also what is stressful when dieting is that we try to lose a large number of weight in such a short period of time which in most cases is unreasonable. \\n\\nThis all brings about stress, discomfort and sadness. When we feel this way, we turn to our best friend for help and support which for many of us is food. The diet is now broken and we feel that we can't stick to diets. We then try fad diet after fad diet hoping to lose the original 20 pounds and now we may have as much as 30 pounds to lose because we continue to put on weight as we continue to break these fad diets by binging before starting our next diet. \\n\\nPlease learn about your relationship with food before your next diet so that you may achieve your goals. To help a little, keep in mind the following:\\n\\nYou already know how to lose weight. You know that if you eat less and exercise more eventually you’ll see the pounds come off. What’s getting in your way? Why do you usually regain the weight you lost? The answer to all these questions is the same “Emotional Eating.” Simply defined, emotional eating means you eat to satisfy emotional hunger; it means you use food for comfort or as a way to cope with life; and it means you eat for reasons other than what your body needs. Whenever you reach for a boredom-breaking snack despite your commitment, or whenever you eat to quell anxiety, that’s emotional eating. Whenever you binge after a fight, or double up on portions because your day turned sour, that’s emotional eating. Whenever you feel that sharp craving for your favorite food, that’s emotional eating. When we eat during these times while on a diet, we believe the diet doesn’t work or that we lack self control and then look for the quickest way to lose weight (fasting/diet pills, ect) after eating all we can since we already messed the diet day up. Read the information below but remember that emotional eating plays a big part in why we don’t continue dieting and why we regain lost weight and why we binge today and start a new diet tomorrow. Best of Luck.\\n\\nP.S. After learning about my relationship with food, I was able to drop my weight from 263 pounds down to 151 pounds which is a 112 pound weight lost.\n"

One thing I like about it (over meeting in person right off the bat) is that there is a little more of a safety margin when you first start chatting on the computer  because you're not actually meeting in person.  My usual approach is to correspond and/or chat online for a little while, maybe talk on teh phone a few times (usually a cell phone) before meeting, and then meeting the person if I feel comfortable with her.  (If I don't feel comfortable with her, there will be no meeting, and might not be anything further than a chat or two online).  The first few dates would probably be in a public place, such as a restaurant.\\n\\nAs with meeting people the old fashioned way, you run the risk of meeting good and bad people, but the internet gives you that initial safety margin to make a better informed decision.\n"

Problem is, I get really nervous when standing in front of a class to present. My English teacher gave us some helpful hints as to not getting shy and nervous in front of the class, but can anyone else explain a bit more thoroughly? Thanks in advance.\nAnswer: I am a teacher who also gets very nervous when doing a presentation or workshop in front of my peers, so try these tricks:\\n\\n1) Practice, practice, practice.  Rehearse in front of your family, friends, a mirror, whatever.  The more you know the material, the easier it will come.  Alot of the times you may get nervous because you are afraid you are going to screw up or look silly.  If you have what you are going to say down, that should help.  \\n\\n2) Before you go up, use the restroom.  On the way there, take big strides and swing your arms steadily.  Your goal here is to burn off the extra adrenaline and rthe exercise will help you relax.\\n\\n3) I cannot remember the proper name for this technique, but it DOES work.  Breathe in, tighten your stomach muscles, working from the top ones down to the bottom ones.  What you are doing is burning off excess adrenaline and at the same time breathing slower and deeper.  I use this one every time and it works great.  Once you have finished with the bottom muscles, exhale and repeat.\\n\\n4)  Relax...Breathe in slowly, hold your breath for 4 to 5 seconds, then slowly exhale.\\n\\n5)  Remember... that nobody sitting there is judging you.  They all understand how nerve racking it can be to speak in public.  They want you to succeed.\\n\\n6)  Pick one friendly, smiling face in the crowd and focus on that one person.  This doesn't mean that you don't scan the room and present to the class, but always return your focus to that one person and you will be ok.\\n\\nHope this helps!\\n\\n\"There are two types of speakers: those that are nervous and those that are liars\". - Mark Twain\n"

        "sentence": "Title: How are scientists considering creating a quantum computer?\nQuestion: What are the techniques suggested in the process?\nAnswer: It will utilise quantum mechanics. At the subatomic level, matter behaves very differently to classical mechanics that we are familiar with in everyday life. The spin property of particles is not actually the particle spinning like a top, but is a term given to their angular momentum to help explain their interaction with each other.\\n\\nParticles can only spin in certain allowable directions, electrons have only 2 directions, other particles can have more. The ability to be in 2 spin states at once is due to uncertainty in that the particle could be in either state until it is observed and probability functions are used to describe its state.\\n\\nSimilarly a particle in a quantum well (a box with walls of electric potential) will move about with its energy in a fashion that can be described by its wave function. At any measurement it will be in a certain point (although with unknown momentum) but it will vary with every measurement.\\n\\nThese sorts of uncertainties are what are scientists are hoping to use in quantum mechanics. Calculations will actually be performed millions of times simultaneously providing varying results, but favourable probabilities will lead to the correct answer with immeasurably small innaccurary.\\n\\nPotential methods will utilise the spin magnetic moments of electrons, or the position of valence (outer) or free electrons moving between pairs of ions (charged atoms) accurately positioned in a semiconductor. There is still a lot of work required.\n"

If you ask them how they liked their assignment they'll tell you it was terrible because \"There's nothing to do.\" But if you put in nothing, you get nothing -- it's that simple. Now, if you're willing to get out -- there's tons of things to do.\\n\\nSpangdahlem is almost right on the border with Belgium. There are all sorts of places you can go for a day trip. You can go to Brussels, Amsterdam, Paris. All of these are a few hours away.\\nThe city of Trier, nearby Spang, is the oldest city in Germany, and has old Roman ruins, and great shopping. \\n\\nEvery base offers language courses to help you integrate.

You can take tours offered by the base and visit anyplace in europe you want to go: Italy? England? Spain? You name it, there are tours.\\n\\nAlso, there's a company called \"Ryanair\" that flies out of a nearby commercial airport that offers super-cheap airfares (say -- twenty dollars -- round trip) to London, and to many other locales in Europe. Take advantage of it.\\n\\nBoth Ramstein and Spang have very active Officers' and Enlisted Spouce's organizations. If you want to be involved with base activities and meet new friends, you'll have all the opportunities you want.\\n\\nYou can travel, you can sightsee, you can shop, you can take classes, you can be involved with the community.

So, Do I also need to pug in a phone line then? If so can I just hook line straight from wall jack to computer? Also, when I type in the number to be dialed do I put in dashes or spaces?\nAnswer: For starters, make sure you're plugging your cable from your wall to the correct jack in your modem.  One usually has a phone icon - don't use that one for the wall connection.  Use that for an actual phone.\\n\\nIf your hear a dial tone from your speakers when you try to fax someone, then that's a good thing - your fax is trying to start up and dial.  If you don't hear a dial tone, again check your plugs.  It may even help to check the wall outlet as well, since that may be part of the problem.\\n\\nAs for dialing, you can usually go either way with dashes or no dashes.  Just be sure to use area codes where necessary.\\n\\nNow be warned - sometimes sending a fax over a cable modem won't work out.  I've had that told to me once, and it turned out that it did work in my case.  But then recently, I tried to fax and they didn't go through all the way.

You will notice that any two multiples of the above will give you the other leg as a multiple.  The theorem is\\n\\nA^2 + B^2 = C^2,  so  3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2,  hence  9 + 16 = 25\\n\\nnow you have\\n\\n2*3 2*4 thus your other leg is 2*5\\n\\n6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2,  which is 36 + 64 = 100\\n\\nas for the angles, use the law of sines\\n\\nsin(90)/5 = sin(a)/3 = sin(b)/4\\n\\nso a = asin(sin(90)*3/5) = ~37 deg\\n\\nhence angles of 90 53 37\n"

Yes, I know. How morbid but I did it anyway. When I had the film developed the picture had this white, misty thing above on of the cars that had what appeared to be wispy wings moving off the photo edge. I didn’t even know what it was until my friend grabbed my arm and told me that I had a photo of a guardian angel. I was amazed and ever since I’m sure angels exist.\n"

A popular myth spread that male circumcision results in fewer infections and the wife of a circumcised male was less likely to get any of the reproductive cancers.
