Because in all actuality only about 50% of the US population actually votes in the presidential election. Then when you divide that number in half, only 51% of that 50% voted for Bush. So really it’s B.S. when people say that a majority of Americans voted for him. What about the other 74%? Please keep that in mind the next time you feel the need to make a presumptuous accusation about all Americans, and \"our\" appointment of Bush to office.\n"

He's going to think \"Daddy likes to wear girl's clothes.\", or, if the sex change has already happened by then, then he'll have another mommy, I'm assuming.

It'll just be one of the things daddy does, like mommy liking to put on her sweatpants to do the laundry or something similar, you know- just a little idiosyncracy.

I send my daughter to a private Christian school. Some people think it's too expensive to send their kids to Christian school, but I tell you it doesn't cost any more than daycare. Most of you probably send your kids to daycare, don't you? Also, you can't put a price on a good Christian education.  They have smaller teacher:student ratios, they focus on academics, they learn good morals, they are allowed to worship as they please (in accordance with the 1st Amendment), they score higher than the national average on tests, and they help to create productive members of society. They are not crime-and-drug ridden like so many public schools. \\nA public school would be the last place I'd send my child if I could help it.\\nIf, however, I did have to send here there, I would be on those teachers, principal and school board like white on rice. I would give them notes saying that they are not to teach my children evolution or any sex education (especially presented by Planned Parenthood!) or any \"diversity\" training (which is really just pro-gay propaganda). I will NOT have my child brainwashed by the public school system. You should be aware that the creation of a free, public school system was one of the tenets of Karl Marx's Humanist Manifesto, which was implemented by Teddy Roosevelt in this country. In fact, most of the tenets of that Manifesto were accomplished in this country in the first half of the 20th century. We have slowly become a socialist nation.\\nBefore that time, children were either home-schooled or private-schooled - and some of the best, most intelligent people our country has ever produced were educated thusly.\n"

This is one of the most common forms of anxiety disorders (more common than Agoraphobia). Over 7% of the population suffers from social anxiety disorder.\\n\\nIf you have social phobia you usually worry that others will notice your anxiety because of your blushing, sweating, shaking, or difficulty getting your words out, (for example).\\n\\nOther fears triggered by social situations include:\\n\\n    * I'll look uncomfortable or awkward\\n    * I'll seem weird or strange\\n    * I'll appear stupid or incompetent\\n    * I'll look embarrassed\\n    * I'll be boring\\n\\nThese fears tend to be triggered when just anticipating the social situation. You may also have noticed that, after the event, you often feel bad or worse when thinking about how you \"performed\". How you actually felt in the situation can play a big role in this \"post-mortem\". \\n\\nThe Social Phobia/Social Anxiety Association, a non-profit organization, seeks to educate about social phobia:\\nhttp://www.socialphobia.org/\\n\\nThey list some good self help books here:\\nhttp://www.socialanxietyinstitute.org/bookstore.html\\n\\nYou should talk with your doctor and ask for a referral to a psychologist who specailizes in Anxiety Disorders.\n"

Valerian root on the other hand, has one major benefit for you. it doesn't to be a pill. u can actually buy this in it's natural form and i think u boil it in some water. the pills for valerian root and melatonin are the most convenient.  there may also be some herbal teas that have it.\\n\\n2.)ur second bet is herbal teas. there are alot of them available a sleep aid and even if they don't have Valerian root they do have other things that work. and drinking something warm before u go to bed usually helps you go to sleep anyhow. warm milk can sometimes do it for me. you need to make sure, however, that you do not drink anything with sugar or caffeine in it at least 2 hours before you go to bed. if i have to go to bed at ten, i don't drink caffeine after 5 pm, or not at all if i can help it. also, u might try not smoking about a half hour before sleeping if u r a smoker.\\n\\n3.) another thing u can try is a sleep CD. my friend Whitney swears by some of them. they have music or sounds or just gentle whispering and she says that some of hers will put u to sleep within 5 minutes of starting them.\\n\\n4.) make sure that you have the most comfortable bed set up possible. if your like me, your body and mind love finding any excuse to get up, and the wrong pillow blanket and mattress is an easy target. i love the foam pillows but the foam mattresses suck for me. but it all depends on you. if you sleep in clothes, make sure they are soft and loose. it's better to sleep in the nude, however. also keeping a room a bit too cold for ur tastes but having plenty of cover is a great way to go to sleep. you'll wrap urself up tightly and u won;t move. soon you'll be asleep. i always sleep better in winter.\\n\\n5.) reading or watching a television show that just DOES NOT INTEREST YOU is another way. i watch the news because i hate the news. sometimes the news can conk me out in the middle of the day. \\n\\n6.)there are plenty of meditation exercises out there and lots of them can relax you to the point of sleepiness. instructions for quite a few should be available on line, but try this one: breath in and fill your lungs all the way up. imagine that when you breathe in you are breathing in a number (the number one for the first breath and so on). fill ur lungs up completely with ones. then breath out all of the ones (emptying ur lungs completely) and then continue with the number two. sounds crazy but it does relax you and if ur laying on ur back in ur bed, it can actually put you to sleep.\\n\\ni hope one of these works!!\n"

Whatever licenses or loopholes the site claims to have in Russia (which I would take with multiple grains of salt... or shots of vodka?), they don't extend to a U.S. citizen who downloads the content inside the U.S. That's where the copying takes place, and that's where the parties have to have a license to make copies. If they don't (and they don't), then you could be in trouble if the files were found on your computer.

I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!\" \\nIn western art, the fruit is most commonly depicted as an apple. One possible reason for this arises from a medieval pun. It was a source of humor to monks that the Latin term for evil (malus) was similar to the word of apple (malum). Thus it was often said that by eating the malum (apple), Eve contracted malus (evil). There is, however, no textual or historical evidence by which to argue the literalness of this image.\\n\\nJewish thought contains additional options. Rabbi Meir says: \"The fruit of (the Tree of Knowledge of Good-and-Evil) was a grape...\"; Rabbi Nechemia says: \"It was a fig...\"; Rabbi Yehuda says: \"It was wheat...\" Talmud, Brachot 40a\\n\\nThe reason it is sometimes surmised to have been a fig is that they used fig leaves to cover themself after eating it, either because the leaves were nearby, or because God creates the cure before the illness, and the same tree that caused the problem is also used to remedy it. Another explanation lies within the \"fruit\" of the fig tree, the fig itself, which is not actually a fruit but rather a flower of sorts, serving as the tree's genitalia. It is said that when they bit into the fig, they saw that what appeared to be a fruit on the outside had concealed the reproductive organs within itself. Adam and Eve then looked at each other and felt ashamed that their reproductive organs were simply exposed, and covered them with the large leaves from the same tree. Some commentators hold that it might have been a grape, and that Eve actually made, and drank, wine.\\n\\nEthno-botanists have proposed the iboga plant (Tabernanthe iboga) as the Tree of Knowledge. The ground up bark contains a dissociative substance, ibogaine, which has been traditionally used in Bwiti religious ceremony in Central Africa. Other hallucinogens, in particular the Fly agaric mushroom, have also been proposed as the Tree.\\n\\nChristian sects like the Coptics of Jamaica, and other peoples of faith, especially the Rastafarians believe it to be the Marijuana plant.\n"

Its not that I am a loner, infact I had a girlfriend in my college days and we did a lot of things together including sex but honestly speaking I had no genuine attraction towards her and it was all peer pressure. Infact apart from her I have never had a relationship with anyone. I stongly feel the need for someone to make my life complete but again I am too freaked out whenever I even get close to a girl I find attractive. Its come to a point where I am not able to talk to even my best friend's wife, though I have no designs on her. In a way I am desperate but I am not able to come outside this inhibition. Help me get outside it, any advice? (By the way I live in India and it is perfectly acceptable to remain single untill marriage)\nAnswer: Hmmmm... I think that you might want to seek professional help with this problem.  See the thing is confidence isn't something that you can teach.  A professional might be able to help you unwrap why you are not confident to begin with, but I am not sure anybody is going to have a magic pill for you.  Well here goes something.  Dude, the key to sexual prosperity, is rejection.  I know that sounds dumb but listen, every time your faced with an attractive woman, you get tense and lock up why? because you're afraid of being rejected and feeling like a loser right?  Well just decide not to feel that way (easier said than done but it doesn't have to be hard).  Try this exercise, go to a bar, and identify 5 women that you are attracted to, and go and introduce yourself, i promise at least 1 will want to at least TALK to you, and then when you feel a bit more confident with talking you can start romancing.  See love, and dating and courtship is a numbers game, and every time you hear a no that is one less you have to hear till you INEVITABLY get a yes.  There are like a billion people in India right? 500,000,000 women, trust me at least 100,000 will want to talk to you or go out on a date with you.  So never take anything a woman says personally, and welcome rejection, as one less hurdle to your inevitable GUARANTEED success, and you may find that you can talk to women after-all.  Good luck bro, and I hope this helps.  I know it sounds crazy but trust me it works.\n"

As stated I have no programming or webpublishing experience but don't mind spending some time on it as long as it doesn't take me months to get up & running.

They have PHP, CGI, MySQL and lots more pre-installed. Then you have to learn PHP and MySQL and write a CMS. Depending on your current status of knowledge in these subjects, it can take about a month or two to go online. Alternatively you may use some of the readymade CMS's available online for free.

Where would I find them?\nAnswer: i was squirrel hunting once when i was 18 and noticed that suddenly everything seemed really green like i was looking through green glass or something. the wind wasnt blowing at all but i could hear howling winds. i walked out of the woods into a field so i could look at the sky and get a good look around because this confused me. no sooner had i reached the field that i saw a twister in the sky. quickly recalling what to do i jumped in a nearby trench and lied down, clenching the grass around me...but i couldnt resist watching it so i lied on my back. at one moment i swear it was only 100 yards or so above me and i could see straight up the middle of it to the sky above. during those long but short 15-20 seconds or so there was literally no wind whatsoever but the sound was immense, almost deffaning. it gave me such an adrenaline rush that nowadays tornadic storms turn me on. then i watched it land on a chicken barn about 1/2 a mile from me and destroy it. the news said that it had jumped from place to place for several hours. all i know is that it was very close to me and i saw the inside of it and it was alot like in the movies when people are momentarily safe inside a twister, but i wasnt lifted off the ground because i was below the ground level in that ditch. i guess its possible\n"

I am interested in learning FACTS. My OPINIONS do not need help being shaped from either Michael Moore or Alan Peterson.\\n\\nThe better documentaries about 9/11 have explored both sides of the events while ignoring obvious left and right-wing propaganda. President Bush's response on 9/11 was not perfect; he DID make some mistakes. But he did a lot of things right, too.\\n\\nKSM (Khalid Sheik Mohammed - that real hairy bastard nabbed in Pakistan a year or so back) has stated in interrogation that al Qaida had planned MORE attacks on the US immediately following 9/11. What al Qaida had NOT expected, however, was President Bush's response. Al Qaida expected a few cruise missiles as an answer, and then life would go on. The Bush Doctrine (\"you are either with us or against us\") and the military operations that accompanied it totally threw al Qaida for a loop and disrupted any chance they had of launching another operation.\\n\\nThe KSM statement alone shows that President Bush has done his job and saved the lives of THOUSANDS - if not tens or hundreds of thousands - of American lives.\n"
