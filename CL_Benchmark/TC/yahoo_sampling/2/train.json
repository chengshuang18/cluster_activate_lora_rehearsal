So a dark Cuban, Peurto Rican, Dominican, etc would have been considered black so they would have experience the same discrimination that blacks had to deal with. However, if you talk about a real light Cuban, Spaniard, Argetine, Puerto Rican, they would have  been considered white, i.e. if they chose to obstain from speaking Spanish,etc and assimilating into the mainstream. \\n So, only the really light Latinos would experience less racism then their darker compatriots.\\n  In the 1940s, Puerto Ricans fought in integrated units during the Second World War, compared to blacks and  Asians which fought in segregated units.\n"

Smug Christians always say that atheists immediately turn to God at the first sign of adversity, but this climber found his atheist beliefs were stronger than ever. In fact, he argues that had he been a believer, he would have accepted events as \"God's will\", and just made his peace and waited either for a miracle rescue, or to die and join God in heaven. Instead, BECAUSE he was an atheist, he lowered himself further into the pitch black crevice. He dragged his broken leg behind him for days, without water, climbing over boulders, etc., and finally made it back to camp. Ironically, the non-atheist at the camp heard him crying for help, thought he was a ghost, and refused to leave the tent to help.  So, my question is, wouldn't a Christian just accepted events, stayed put, prayed and died?\nAnswer: If he's an athiest how would he know what he would do as a believer??\n"

Since Energy is expressed in joules which is a measure of work - moving one newton of mass one meter-, a measurement in meters per second was needed for the energy equation to solve with the proper units. Einstein believed that the square of the speed of light would account for the most extreme accleration possible and therefore would produce the highest theoretical yield of energy. At least that's what a lot of scientists think Einstein thought. Not a lot of people have had the capacity to think like Einstein so we are all just guessing from his speeches, writings, and calculations what he really thought.\n"

Tradition is no reason to continue a practice.  To say that we should prohibit gays from marrying because we have not allowed it up til now and marriage has traditionally be between a man and a woman it no different that that standard answer your parents gave you when you asked why you could not eat your dessert first -- \"because we say so.\"  Makes no sense.  It offers no logic.  Guess what else is tradition -- traditionally we don't let jews play at our golf courses.  And traditionally we don't let blacks marry whites (there were actually laws on the book in most states, so it went beyond tradition, it was the law).  Traditionally, children slept on their stomaches, until the scientists told us that the chances of SIDS skyrocketed when an infant doesn't sleep on its back.  So don't give me that tradition garbage.  We don't continue doing things just because that how it has always been done.  The american people deserve better than that -- we deserve to know how it benefits the overall society.

It tastes a lot like white rice, but it has more nutrients.\\nhttp://www.foodsubs.com/Rice.html#converted\\nConverted rice: Converted rice has been soaked and steamed under pressure before milling, which forces some of the nutrients into the remaining portion of the grain so that they are not completely lost in the processing. Enriched parboiled rice is similar to regular enriched rice in terms of thiamin, niacin, and iron, but it has more potassium, folate (folic acid), riboflavin, and phosphorous, though not as much as brown rice. Converted rice takes a little longer to cook than regular rice, but the grains will be very fluffy and separate after they have been cooked. \\nhttp://www.wholehealthmd.com/refshelf/foods_view/1,1523,75,00.html\n"

I insist on telling her she is fine the way she is and is beautiful but she thinks she is huge. She's told me she is on this diet that she only eats 800 calories a day. Is this true? is this healthy? will she lose weight? I don't want her to get hurt but she won't listen to me what can I do to help her!!!!!!\nAnswer: Yes, she will lose weight. And muscle tissue and brain functionality,strength and endurance. She is dangerously below what she needs in a day (usually 1200-1600 calories are recommended for those who are extremely overweight). Sounds like she may need to seek counseling because if she sees something different than what really exists when she looks in the mirror, then her mind's eye needs to be reprogrammed. These are often beginning signs of anorexia and bulimia. Encourage her to talk to a counselor. She is in danger of harming herself by doing these things. This is not the time to keep your thoughts to yourself. If necessary, ask for help from a trusted adult to intervene. She may get mad at you, but it's worth it to save her life. Be encouraged.\n"

Once you give the examples of body language you can then explain how someone could interpret folded arms as someone who is supposedly protecting themselves or is being unapproachable.

        "sentence": "Question: How do wirlpools start in the ocean?\nAnswer: As the water starts to circle, it is thrown to the outside, due to centrifugal force (to be more accurate, the force that it experiences is centripetal force=(mv^2)/r since centrifugal force is a so-called fictitious force). As it's thrown outside, it starts to move faster (when things move in a circle, the things that are nearer the outside move faster than things near the center; you can see this if you have a \"old-fashioned\" record player by putting two coins on it, one near the center and one near the outer edge and trace how long it takes them to complete the lengths of their paths). So the circling water near the outer rim is moving very fast and experiences bigger forces (since the force is proportional to velocity). But the water near the middle is moving slower because it's being dragged along the bottom and so ends up slowing down much more. Since the water near the bottom is moving so slowly, it exhibits a much lower centrifugal force and so there is little to no centrifugal force near the bottom (or middle). This is why you have a whirlpool (vortex): the water near the top is pushed out more (since there's higher centrifugal force there) and the water near the bottom is hardly pushed outward at all (since there's lower centrifugal force near the bottom to push it out).\n"

This was much like Linux is today.  Anyone could get the soruce code and use it.  The system was not copyrighted.\\nBill Gates borrowed the code to write the original DOS which he sold to the IBM corporation.  What had been public property was now his personal stuff.  Thousands of computers programmers were shafted and Bill became rich and famous.\\nNext Bill's blonders:  Bill never liked the internet because he could not control it and because of the opening of communications between humans not using his products.  He never really want to see personal computers link into local networks either, but changed his mind when he figured out how much additional money he could make.  These are the reasons why Windows products lagged so far behind Networks like Novell and internet servers which use Unix.\\nLast, I met Bill at a convention one time.

Once the young seahorses are ready to lead independent lives, he dumps them out of the sac.\\n\\nI think it is comparable to the way male emus incubate the eggs of their partners.  Male emus (an Australian bird, similar to the ostrich and rhea) also cares for the young; they follow him, for a while after hatching.\\n\\nSee?  The females lay eggs / give birth, really.  These males just participate in care of their offspring.  Their babies are thus more likely to grow up and have offspring; the trait has selective advantages.\\n\\nIn general, females put a lot more into young than males do.  In some species, the way \"female\" is distinguished from \"male\" is by comparing the size of their gametes.  Note how sperm are smaller than ova, for example.  In many cases, the female adds a huge load of nutrients to the young, too; the yolk + / or white of the egg, the placental nutrition of the foetus, the milk of mammals...  It all weakens the females, in cases where nutrients are limiting (which is the normal situation, \"in the wild\".\\n\\nIn cases where males take on the bulk of after - care, it just evens the load a bit, really.

About one third of the population lives on or below the UN poverty line; less than 3 per cent of Indian households have an income of more than US$2,500 a year.\n"

This person that told you about the \"basics of Spanish\" doesn't make sense to me =( \\n\\nI guess the 'basics' of a language could be the 500 most used words plus all grammar (however you might define grammar..). Then the rest of the words would be easier to learn. The thing with language is that it's hard to say what is the most important thing to know. If you look at vocabulary and grammar, just one out of these two won't get you very far. I guess for tourists it's most important to know some basic sentence structures with some loose words to fill in (\"Do you know where the [toilet/hotel/museum/restaurant] is?\"). Still, that doesn't mean you know a language. I guess for Italians it would be like that, though. If they knew the basic differences between their own language and the Spanish language, they would probably find Spanish quite easy. This doesn't go for English and Spanish, though. English is a Germanic language, Spanish is a a Romanic language. They are too different.\\n\\nSo.. unless Spanish has some secret code to it, I don't know what the person was thinking.\n"

Fuck it maybe i'll just take my own life tonight that will solve the problem indefinately.\nAnswer: I was a virgin until I was 25. Then that situation was happily remedied.\\n\\nI think that life is a lot more than just sex. Obviously, sex is something we all desire. And, we do deserve at some point to experience that joy. It can seem like it will never happen when you go so long before you finally \"get some\", but for some of us, things just have to fall into place first. \\n\\nMy suggestion isn't the same as those freaks that just say \"let it happen naturally\"... I had to realize that I was getting older and it wasn't happening for a reason. It wasn't them - it was me. And, the best thing is, the only thing I can change is ME.\\n\\nYou can change yourself. Some things you can't change, but some things you can. Make an effort to have more FRIENDS of the female gender. Be a genuine friend. Don't guilt them over not having sex with you, don't pressure them to date you. You can start out just by being nice to random ones you meet (work, college, etc). Be positive around them. Even if inside you are still bitter - only let the positive out. Eventually someone will appreciate your effort, even if she sees through it. Effort earns a lot of points.

The mosque at Al-Azhar is one of the most famous in the Muslim world, and is still considered the seat of Sunni Islamic study. \\n\\nThe university pioneered systems of advanced academic instruction with its hierarchy of regular instructors and visiting professors. Its history follows the turbulent rise of the Islamic Empire, replete with political revolutions and competing religious philosophies. While Al-Azhar University has a storied history of religious instruction, it also boasts a robust secular curriculum, offering advanced degrees in engineering and medicine. \\n\\nAs with all matters medieval, historical facts and figures are up to academic interpretation. Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fez, Morroco, has also laid claim to the title of oldest university in the world. \\n\\nEurope's oldest university was founded in 1088 in the northern Italian city of Bologna.

Okay, I worked out every week at least 3-4 times a week for a straight hour, and I would walk uphill at the highest incline at 4.3 miles an hr on the treadmill.  This went well, I burned 700 something cals an hour and combined with eating healthy, I managed to get from 130 in July to like 112 or so in early Nov.  Now I realized that my heart rate was NOT high at all- it was barely more than a resting rate! So I started running in the beginning of Nov (this month) and since then (Its been what, three weeks?) I have noticed MAJOR changes in my body.  I am suddenly a LOT slimmer, and have all this extra skin around my stomach from where I obviously just lost fat.  WHY?  Why so quick? Does it have to do with the heart rate? Its weird because I am burning less calories now- I run on the treadmill at a good steady pace of 5.6-6.5 miles an hour for about 30-40 min 5 times a week. But why did these physical changes just start showing up? My diet is good....\nAnswer: the calorie count on the machine may not be accurate.....if your heart rate is higher, you are likely burning more calories\\n\\nalso, you may have built up some muscle, which takes a little time......if this is the case, you should be burning more calories all day and night, and this will definitely speed up weight loss......\\n\\nalso, since you have less weight to lose, any loss will be a lot more obvious.....you may just lose a couple of pounds, and notice a big change, where before you wouldn't have noticed any just from losing that amount.........\n"

Celiac primarily impacts the digestive system, but advanced cases of the disease get all sorts of autoimmune problems and nutrient deficiencies - one of which is bone and joint pain. Once he quit getting gluten in his diet his pain completely went away. \\n\\nIf he gets a gluten infraction the pain will return. We had that last summer when they had cookouts at work pretty regularly for several weeks in a row. He was careful to select foods that were gluten free, but he kept getting a reaction each time. Since he could find no initial cause, he figured he just had a mild viral infection. By the end of two weeks he had terrible bone and joint pain. We finally discovered that Kingsford charcoal uses gluten as a binding agent in their bricketts. The cookouts were with Kingsford. Kingsford stated that the gluten would burn up completely and couldn't contaminate the food; however, my husband's body showed them to be wrong. He quite eating the grilled foods and his symptoms subsided in just a few days. We have come arcross several other celiacs since then who said they had the same problem with Kingsford.\\n\\nSo, if your doctor hasn't difinitively gotten test results that prove arthritis, do a bit of research to see what conditions have this pain as a symptom.\\n\\nGood luck.\n"

It is no longer forced since it is nothing more than a religious ritual. In fact you must request it now days or a Dr will suggest it . Most jewish doctors insist it is important but it is really not.\\n\\n  In fact it does destroy the sensitivity of a male. The bible often rebukes it as a religeous cult of the Babylonians which was introduced into Judaism as part of their cult ritual which was later imposed upon the American peoples and now is no longer required. \\n\\n   Jesus even rebuked the Jews as \"those of the circumcission\" which implies that it is not required of GOD. It is destruction of the flesh as GOD made it and any religion that practices it is merely a cult that goes against the nature and creation of GOD and implies that GOD is inept in his creation of man. It is not required by GOD nor for any such myth as cleanliness! It is simply a Judeo religeous cult which brings sin to a person because of cutting the flesh of man. It is immoral scripturally and should never be imposed upon a child until that child alone can make that decission for himself. It is mutilation of the body against GODs creation\\n\\n   It is simply a cult Judeo  religeous practice which the Bible warns us against in Titus 1:3-4 about believe anything that comes from the mouth of a Judaizer and how they will pervert the laws of GOD. If God who created all His creation as perfect and \"good\" (as stated inthe bible)  , wanted man to be circumsized then man would have been born that way. Circumcission is a cult injection into GODs perfect word and doing so brings sin against man. Circumcission is a biblical mistranslation and illegal interjection into the word of GOD. True Bible scholars know that the bible speaks of it as a cult ritual of the Judaizers and Babylonians, not that of Gods True chosen people.\n"

I NEED EXCERCISES, ENDURANCE, QUOTES. etc.\nAnswer: Here is some advice I previously posted to another 400m runner.\\n\\nIf you aren't already running 600m in your workout, add them once a week. They build up your strength and help you maintain your speed over that last 100m.  Not knowing your ability, I would say try to run them going out the first 400 at a pace 5-10 seconds slower than your best 400m and then concentrate on staying strong to the finish.\\n\\nI would also to workouts with multiple 400s, 5-10 seconds slower than your best 400 time, or multiple 200s, a second or two faster than your 400m pace.\\n\\nYou might also try running shorter intevals up a long hill. Back in the 60's, the UCLA team used to run 400s up a long hill. They had the best 4x400 team in the country back then, so the there is evidence that the workouts did some good. \\n\\nYou need to learn how to run the race correctly. I break the race down into 4 100s. For most of the first 100, you should be accelerating smoothly to your \"cruising pace\", running hard, but not sprinting all out. The 2nd and 3rd 100s, should be fast, but relaxed. The last 100 is where your strength will have to kick in. You are going to start to feel like someone dropped a weight on your back. We used to say \"The bear got him\" when we'd watch it happen to a runner in a big way.\\n \\nYou'll need to focus on keeping you knees going straight forward. They will want to go off at an angle.  Keep your arms swinging straight ahead. Some runners feel it helps them to exagerate their armswing as it helps keep their legs going.  \\n\\nRelax your face and jaw. Don't grimace. When you do, it thightens up first your face, then your neck and shoulders.\\n\\nAfter a hard run, do a lot of stretching. You've got to have a full range of motion to have a smooth, effortless stride.\\n\\nI always recommend Bob Anderson's stretching book, it's a classic: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0936070226/002-4340010-1751209&#92;\n"

They also share all the other characteristics of birds, being warm-blooded (around 40 deg C) and having a reduced reproductive system (one functional ovary or testis).\\nLike all other birds, penguins have feathers. Penguin feathers are short, overlapping and densely packed. The outer part of the feather is waterproof while the inner down section traps an insulating layer of air, keeping the penguin warm in the sometimes freezing water. Unlike those of flying birds, the feathers on a penguin wing are very short.\n"

Your not exactly living la viva loca ... please get back on your meds ...\\n\\nAlthough often still discussed in contemporary American politics as representing the quintessential \"fringe\" end of the far-right spectrum, today the group only exists in the form of a number of very isolated, scattered \"supporters\" that probably do not number more than a few thousand. In a 2002 report on \"Extremism in America\", the Anti-Defamation League wrote \"Today, there is no such thing as the Ku Klux Klan. Fragmentation, decentralization and decline have continued unabated.\" However, they also noted that the \"need for justification runs deep in the disaffected and is unlikely to disappear, regardless of how low the Klan's fortunes eventually sink.\"\\n\\nToday the only known former member of the Klan to hold a Federal office in the United States is Senator Robert Byrd, who says he \"deeply regrets\" joining the Klan over half a century ago, when he was about 24 years old. There are currently no known members of the Klan who also hold a Federal office.\\n\\nSome of the larger KKK organizations currently in operation include:\\n\\n•Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan \\n\\n•Imperial Klans of America \\n\\n•Knights of the White Kamelia \\n\\nThere is a vast number of smaller organizations. As of 2005, there were an estimated 3,000 Klan members, divided among 158 chapters of a variety of splinter organizations, about two-thirds of which were in former Confederate states. The other third are primarily in the Midwest region. \\n\\nThe ACLU has provided legal support to various factions of the KKK in defense of their First Amendment rights to hold public rallies, parades, and marches, and their right to field political candidates.\\n\\nIn a July 2005 incident, a Hispanic man's house was burned down in Hamilton, Ohio, after accusations that he sexually assaulted a nine-year-old white girl. Klan members in Klan robes showed up afterward to distribute pamphlets.\\n\\nSensitivity to the highly-charged topic of the KKK is in evidence at professional baseball games. Fans will sometimes post a letter \"K\" (the scoring symbol for strikeout) every time the home team pitcher strikes out a batter. Typically the letters will be spaced in such a way that no three consecutive K's are run together. Another approach is to have every third one be a backwards K, although a reversed K more typically denotes a strikeout in which the batter does not swing at the third strike.\n"
