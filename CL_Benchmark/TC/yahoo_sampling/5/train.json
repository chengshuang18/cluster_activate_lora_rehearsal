        "sentence": "Title: How is Lake Chad's current shrinking different than shrinking in the past?\nQuestion: According to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chad ):\\n\\n\"Lake Chad is believed to be a remnant of a former inland sea which has grown and shrunk with changes in climate over the past 13,000 years....Climate change, due in part to global warming, and increased demands on the lake's water have accelerated its shrinkage over the past 40 years....It seems likely that the lake will shrink further and perhaps even disappear altogether in the course of the 21st century....The lake nearly dried out in 1908 and again in 1984 and has an average depth of only 1.5 metres.\"\\n\\nIf Lake Chad has shrunk repeatedly in the past, then why is it now so worrisome? Is its current shrinking part of a normal cycle for the lake, or is global warming (or human usage or something else) making this worse than the past shrinkages? Is this shrinking permanent?\\n\\nLake Chad is often used as a prime example of global warming, but I don't understand how the current shrinkage is different than in the past.\nAnswer: You have a reasonable argument that current shrinkage may not be that different from the past: \\nThis from USGS web site:\\nFluctuations are not new to Lake Chad. About 10,000 years ago Lake Chad almost filled its present drainage basin, and spilled southwest out the Benue River to the Atlantic. In the last 1,000 years, according to fossil evidence, the lake probably dried out a half-dozen times. (Most of its fish are river-adapted species.) Geologic data, climate data, historical accounts and reconstructions all indicate a higher long-term variability than the relatively short period we have actually measured. The chart shown here shows levels since the 1870s, from actual measurements and from estimates based on Nile River discharge.6\\n\\nFollowing highs in the 1870s and 1890s, the lake dropped enough by 1908 to separate into north and south pools, with the \"Great Barrier\" between. In the 1950s the lake rose enough to flood out irrigation systems, peaking this century in 1962. The lake then tapered off until the early 1970s, when it plummeted. The recent low levels are a concern, and have been monitored through satellite and other means by the Lake Chad Basin Commission and others.==url below\\n\\nWhether or not it has dried out in the past, people have come to rely on it. Worrisome, I'm sure, to government agencies concerned with food supplies, irrigation, biodiversity, water availability etc.  And I would suppose that any future increase in drought or temperature  warming would guarantee a smaller lake, or its disappearance again.\n"

This is one of the most common forms of anxiety disorders (more common than Agoraphobia). Over 7% of the population suffers from social anxiety disorder.\\n\\nIf you have social phobia you usually worry that others will notice your anxiety because of your blushing, sweating, shaking, or difficulty getting your words out, (for example).\\n\\nOther fears triggered by social situations include:\\n\\n    * I'll look uncomfortable or awkward\\n    * I'll seem weird or strange\\n    * I'll appear stupid or incompetent\\n    * I'll look embarrassed\\n    * I'll be boring\\n\\nThese fears tend to be triggered when just anticipating the social situation. You may also have noticed that, after the event, you often feel bad or worse when thinking about how you \"performed\". How you actually felt in the situation can play a big role in this \"post-mortem\". \\n\\nThe Social Phobia/Social Anxiety Association, a non-profit organization, seeks to educate about social phobia:\\nhttp://www.socialphobia.org/\\n\\nThey list some good self help books here:\\nhttp://www.socialanxietyinstitute.org/bookstore.html\\n\\nYou should talk with your doctor and ask for a referral to a psychologist who specailizes in Anxiety Disorders.\n"

For example: New shoes $120 12 months = $10 a month.\\n\\nYou will have in your budget items that are considered 'fixed' items - like rent/mortgage, utilities, gas/transportation, etc.\\n\\nLine your fixed items up, then your goals under that, next to all of them will be your monthly figure. Once you have a total, you subtract that from your net(in pocket) pay.\\n\\nYou will either have money left over OR you will not have enough - this is when you need to rework your budget - for example: New shoes $120 2 years (24 months) = $5 and so on.\\n\\nI have used new shoes, but of course it can be anything that is important to YOU.\\n\\nPlease consider, as part of your budget, money for emergencies. Six to twelve months of FIXED living expenses (or somewhere in between ) is a good number. This (emergency fund) may take you a while, but it will be well worth it when you have an emergency.\\n\\nIf you have a preadsheet program, Xcel or any other, this will make the calculations easier - as it will recalculate as you change items.\\n\\nGood luck!\n"

If you have ever?\nQuestion: made a change to your diet and fitness, please help!!!!\\n\\nI've tried contacting a dietitian on Craigs List, but he kept promoting some box drinks...I want to learn HOW to eat properly, not be fed something that supposedly IS healthy.\\n\\nFOr instance, what is a healthy breakfast?\\nHow do you stave off hunger?\\n\\nIs it best to withdraw from food at the beginning (like a fast) to prepare your system?\\n\\nPls advise....\nAnswer: A healthy diet consists of a variety of food groups....let me be specific. Lets say you are a female (which I think you are) with a moderate activity level, for example: exercise 3 times a week for 45 min. or 5 times a week for 20 mins. This includes stretching 4 times a week and some sort of strength training (this could be as simple as carrying groceries for a few blocks or actually weight lifting) once or twicw weekly. It is recommended (Canada's food guide) that you eat 1900-2200 calories per day. ;Broken down even further, the food guide suggests:\\n7 fruits/vegetables\\n7 grains\\n3 dairy products\\n2 meat/alternatives\\n6 fats (1 fat serving is every 5g of extra oil, butter, you get the picture)\\nThis combination of food equals roughly 2000 cal. (try not to get caught up in the numbers, this will only make you crazy)\\nAlso, try eating this combination of food in the form of 3 meals and 3 snacks. Every meal and snack should consist of a carbohydrate source (such as fruit/vegetables, grains) and a protein source (dairy or meat). This combination helps you to feel full and satisfied (as well as keeps your metabolism working) throughout the day. Try aiming for 2 food groups for snacks and at least three food groups for meals. Always try to eat breakfast within the first half hour of waking up then have a snack about 2 and a half hours later, then lunch 2 and a half hours later then.....you get it, this way until bed time snack. I don't advise withdrawing from food to begin with your body is always prepared to be treated well :-).\\nHope this helps, it can be time consuming but in the end you will feel better then you ever have and your body thanks you for it.\\nGood luck and happy birthday!\n"

No ab exercise or machine reduces the size of your abs. Most of the claims made by such companies are fictitious and have no basis on science. Focus on eating 4 to 5 small healthy meals a day consisting of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, unsalted nuts and seeds and if you eat meat select baked, broiled fish, chicken and turkey. Avoid fast food and junk like sodas. Begin by going on a brisk walk with your baby for 4,000 steps daily. Slowly increase your distance each week with a goal to do 8 to 10 thousand steps a day.

        "sentence": "Title: Why do people try to get around what the bible says about homosexulity?\nQuestion: What does the Bible say about homosexuality?\\n \\n\\n     There are those who like to say that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality.  Various verses are cited (out of context) and the verses that people use to show that homosexuality is wrong are explained away.  The world wants to change God's words and meanings into something more suitable to its sinful desires.  Nevertheless, the truth stands:  The Bible condemns homosexuality as a sin. Let's look at what it says. \\n\\nLev. 18:22, \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\" \\n\\nLev. 20:13, \"If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them\" \\n\\n1 Cor. 6:9-10, \"Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\" \\n\\nRom. 1:26-28, \"For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.\" \\n\\n      Homosexuality is clearly condemned by the Bible.   It goes against the created order of God.  He created Adam and then made a woman.  This is what God has ordained and it is what is right.  Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a severe judgment administered by God Himself. This judgment is simple: They are given over to their passions. That means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins (Romans 1:18ff). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance and trusting in Jesus. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation. \\n\\nWhat should be the Christian's Response to the Homosexual? \\n\\n      Just because someone is a homosexual does not mean that we cannot love him (or her) or pray for him (her). Homosexuality is a sin and like any other sin, it needs to be dealt with in the only way possible. It needs to be laid at the cross, repented of, and never done again. \\n      As a Christian, you should pray for the salvation of the homosexual the same you would any other person in sin. The homosexual is still made in the image of God -- even though he is in grave sin.  Therefore, you should show him same dignity as anyone else you come in contact with. However, this does not mean that you are to approve of their sin. Don't compromise your witness for a socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness.\nAnswer: If I give you that the bible does seem to indicate that homosexuality is NOT a preferred activity for men (although women are never mentioned in this  context)...\\n\\nCan you give me the fact it is not one of the 10 commandments and thus not one of the mortal sins and thus is a venial (lesser) sin.\\n\\nAND the fact that we accept and seemingly encourage intentional violation of the mortal sins and the 10 Commandments.\\n\\nIn the sake of time, I will just point out two...\\n\\n5th Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Kill.\\n- WE still sentence criminals to death & send soldiers to kill innocents\\n\\n10th Commandment: Thou Shalt not Covet thy Neighbor's Property.\\n- Do we not encourage avarice and envy through fashion, fads, marketing, and waste?\\n\\nThe issue is, Humans are flawed, we kill, steal, have greed, sloth, and much, much more. \\n\\nAs long as you hold 100% true to your beliefs, and REFUSE to support leaders who send troops to kill, encourage greed, do not believe in charity, encourage us to shop to fight terrorists, et al, then I will back you 100% in any argument you make supporting the teachings of the bible. \\n\\nI have complete respect for an enlightened person willing to not be selective in THEIR views as well and not spout a \"socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness\"\n"

Without sufficient atmospheric pressure, body fluids will start to heat up and boil. Without oxygen, we would be unable to breathe. \\nThe parts of a spacesuit\\n\\nSpacesuits serve many functions. Today's spacesuits are pressurized, have an oxygen supply, protect the astronaut from micrometeoroid bombardment while spacewalking, and insulate the astronaut from the severe temperature changes experienced in space. The Space Shuttle astronauts have more than one \"outfit\" for space travel. What they wear while on a mission is determined by the job they are doing. During the launch and re-entry, the astronauts wear a partially pressurized suit and a parachute pack. The suit has a helmet, gloves, and boots which all serve as protection for the astronaut. Within the suit are bladders that automatically fill with air at reduced cabin pressures. At low pressure, the blood will pool in the lower body causing the astronaut to black out. The bladders maintain the pressure on the lower body to prevent this from happening. While working in the Shuttle during orbit, astronauts work in comfortable clothes such as knit shirts, pants, or flight suits. In addition, prior to each mission, flight crews are outfitted with lined jackets, sleep shorts, slippers, and underwear. \\nWhile working outside of the Shuttle during a mission, astronauts wear an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU). This suit has interchangeable parts so it can be assembled to fit different astronauts. This makes the suit more cost effective since it can be reused. The EMU has a liquid cooling garment, which is a one piece suit made of spandex, and keeps the astronaut cool while in the suit. The unit also contains headphones and microphones, a drink bag which carries water, a life support system containing oxygen, and a urine collection device. Gloves are included with the unit along with a helmet and a visor. All of this is necessary to protect the astronaut from micrometeoroids, solar radiation, infrared radiation, temperature changes, pressure changes, and oxygen deprivation.\n"

        "sentence": "Question: What's a quick and HEALTHY way to lose weight?\nAnswer: Eat right and exercise. Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fruits, vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work to there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit.\\nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me.

Is that a fact?\nAnswer: Hi Kevin\\n\\nHere are a few ideas on how to heal your condition.\\n\\nCause\\n\\nNutrient deficiencies, thyroid disorders, and stress can all contribute to epileptic seizures and must be screened for and addressed as part of a comprehensive treatment approach. Proper bowel movements two to three times a day are also important. If necessary, consider a bowel cleanse to restore healthy bowel function. \\n\\nPioneering holistic dentist Hal Huggins, D.D.S., has noted the improvement, and in some cases the complete disappearance of epilepsy symptoms after removing toxic dental amalgams. If you have such amalgams in your mouth, consider having them replaced by someone properly trained in Holistic Dentistry. \\n\\nCaution: If the individual's seizure does not stop within 5-10 minutes, seek immediate medical assistance. At the same time, be sure not to over-drug the patient, as medical drugs can actually trigger epilepsy due to their potential side effects.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNatural Cures\\n\\nDiet: Individuals affected by epilepsy should eat a low-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, and eliminate fried foods, salt, sugar, meat, milk, and alcohol. For long-term care, they should follow a hypoglycemic diet (see Hypoglycemia), being sure to avoid artificial sweeteners, excessive refined carbohydrates, and caffeine. For epilepsy accompanied by sluggish bowels or constipation, also ensure that the diet is rich with fibrous foods. \\n\\nEmergency Techniques You Can Use When Someone Is Having A Seizure: Remain calm and move sharp objects away from the affected individual. Keep him or her from putting anything in the mouth, and loosen his or her clothing. If possible, put the person on the floor or bed and stay at the individual's side until the episode runs its course. \\n\\nHerbs: For petit mal epilepsy, take one teaspoon of skullcap tincture three times a day. \\n\\nHydrotherapy: Hydrotherapy is the application of water, ice, steam and hot and cold temperatures to maintain and restore health. Treatments include full body immersion, steam baths, saunas, sitz baths, colonic irrigation and the application of hot and/or cold compresses. Hydrotherapy is effective for treating a wide range of conditions and can easily be used in the home as part of a self-care program. Many Naturopathic Physicians, Physical Therapists and Day Spas use Hydrotherapy as part of treatment. I suggest several at-home hydrotherapy treatments. \\n\\nJuice Therapy: Drink a combination of celery, carrot, and lettuce juice three times a day.\\n\\nNutritional Supplementation: The following nutrients can help minimize symptoms of epilepsy: L-taurine and L-tyrosine amino acids (500 mg three times daily) along with an amino acid blend (two times daily); vitamin B complex and vitamins B3 (niacin), B5, B6 and B12; calcium; choline (start with 4 g daily and increase to 10-12 g within three months); dimethyl glycine (100 mg two times daily); magnesium; manganese; and zinc. Vitamin B complex injected intramuscularly may also be helpful.\\n\\nNote: Sometimes essential fatty acids aggravate symptoms, so consult with a nutritional expert to determine if this is the case.\\n\\nAlternative Professional Care\\nIf your symptoms persist despite the above measures, seek the help of a qualified health professional. The following professional care therapies have all been shown to be useful for treating and relieving the symptoms of epilepsy: Acupuncture, Ayurveda, Biofeedback Training, Bodywork, Chiropractic, Craniosacral Therapy, Detoxification Therapy, Environmental Medicine, Holistic Dentistry, Hypnotherapy, Magnetic Field Therapy, Meditation, Mind/Body Medicine, Naturopathic Medicine, Osteopathy, Reflexology, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Yoga\\n\\nBest of health to you\\n\\nCheers\n"

Some people might say it's conspiracy theory, but some of it just seems to fall into place. If none of that is true, just look at what he has done with foreign policy. He's isolated the U.S. not many countries are very happy with us right now. I've had friends who have traveled abroad that have to say they're from Canada just to not get yelled at and ridiculed. Pro Bush people (I live with one) believe that he is doing a great job, that the war in Iraq was justified to remove Saddam (who had nothing to do with 911 and no wmds.) So now we sit here with an ongoing war that was declared over by bush with rising fuel prices due to his provoking of foreign nations as well as creating instability in the region we import our oil from. Now venezuela bolivia and cuba have cut trade with the U.S. because of all of them dislike of bush, and his policies. The big picture is to create a world government (democracy) and have everyone live free while big business rakes in the cash. My thought is live and let live. I know that there are countries that opress and ones that don't but you would think that in todays da and age we could use diplomacy to settle disputes instead of threatening them with bombs. We are so set in the past of Vietnam, WWI, WWII, that we for some reason think that the world owes us something when they don't owe us crap. Yes our troops faught and died for other countries, but so did their citizens. We were at one time united against a common enemy, and yes there is a common enemy of terrorism, but bush distorted that idea and crusaded around saying we needed to rid the world of people like North Korea, Iran, Iraq, it was just so easy for him to gain support by blaming it all for 911. Ok so I'm rambling, but I hope that might give you some idea. The big picture isn't for everyone.\n"

Enough for her to save with but not enough for your MaMa to notice.  If she can I'd tell her to save for the cell phone and then to keep saving so she has a nest egg.

He may give you an oral med to take.  Or if you prefer over-the-counter treatments like vaginal suppositories/creams, you can clear it up in a few days. There are a couple of different kinds; if one ingredient doesn't work, try a different one.  Also over-the-counter cortisone cream will relieve the itch. Stay clear of sweets, white \"carbs\" like bread and pasta, eat yogurt with acidophalus cultures included (kills yeast) or take the over-the-counter acidophalus capsules.  Wear natural-fiber, loose fitting clothing and cotton panties/bras.  You want to keep the areas as dry as possible.  You can apply cornstarch to soothe and dry the areas also.  Don't use harsh soaps; try a bath in tipid water with 1/2 cup of oatmeal in a wash cloth tied with a rubberband.  It's a great gentle cleanser and won't irritate your delicate skin.  If you have an intimate partner, they will want to be treated also as you can pass this back and forth.  Hope this helps cause I know you must be miserable.  God bless.\n"

Is it better to switch doors after one has been removed?\\nMany have answered \"yes\" and others \"no\". \\nI am interested in your thoughts and comments on this problem.\\nBest answer gets 10 points.\nAnswer: Using probability, you can show that it is better to switch.  It does raise your chance of winning a good prize.\\n\\nLet's think of this in terms of having two doors with a goat and one door with a car.  Thus, the probability that you originally picked the car is 1/3 and probability that you origianally picked a goat is 2/3.\\n\\nIf you picked the car (1/3 probability), then one of the two doors with a goat would be openned.  If you switch, then you get a goat automatically.  If you picked one of the goats (2/3 probability), then the other goat would be shown.  If you switch, you would win the car.

Epidemiological studies estimate that that around 1% of the entire population likely meet criteria for bipolar. Yet, psychiatrist in particular seem to like to diagnose this disorder whenever they hear somebody has an elevated mood between bouts of depression or has signs of agitation during a depressive phase. These symptoms may be indicative of bipolar, but bipolar requires much more. As a psychologist at a major medical institution, I can tell you that in the past 5 years I've only seen maybe ten true cases of bipolar, but I've probably seen over 100 patients who were incorrectly diagnosed with this disorder. If you think you have bipolar or a psychiatrist diagnosed you with it, you should get a second opinion from a doctoral level psychologist (i.e., Ph.D. or Psy.D.). The other way bipolar tends to be over used is if somebody you know seems unreliable or overly emotional. Such symptoms do not necessarily indicate bipolar, but the media and untrained physicians will use this phrase almost as a colloquialism.\n"

Just practice controlling yourself (try thinking of non-sexy things when you get close- like grandma on the toilet, lol- and masturbate beforehand so you aren't so close and on the edge going into things.

At the end of the 2nd World War, instead of our chemical weapons being destroyed, they diluted it, & sold it to the farmer's to kill small insects from destroying their crops, at higher levels it kills small animals, & at higher doses it kills humans!  This stuff is on our fruits, vegetables, in our food.  It is amazing what is acceptable when they call it \"Natural\" flavoring.  Exactly what chemical is \"flavoring\">? this chemicals are killing us and the FDA allows it. Only for the money!  Read the book, it contains compiled facts, that back up what he writes. You will be truly amazed. The book is worth every penny.  You could probably get it at Amazon.com. or ebay. check the price for the best value.  It is available in hardcover. Hope this will allow you to realize the greed going on among the doctors, pharmacutical companies, & our politicians, corporations, & agencies.  They don't care about the  people, it's all about the money.\n"

Wiretapping without a warrant is a federal crime, punishable by up to 5 years in prison.\\n\\nI would not impeach him, however. He needs to concentrate on running the country.
