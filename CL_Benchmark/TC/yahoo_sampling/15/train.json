But, it always leaks and I always have these stupid stains. I'm going on vacation to Washington DC, and I think I'll get it there. Aside from the point that it'll ruin my vacation, I'm also mad because I'm sharing a suite with my mom, my  mom's friend, and my aunt & cousin. What do I do?\nAnswer: To avoid stains you should put on panty liners in your panties while you wear tampons then once it gets full you can change them like you would a regular pad. You should never wear tampons when you are sleeping. You could forget you have it on in the morning or you could have more of a leakage while you're sleep with it on. Always wear pads while you are sleeping. It shouldn't be that bad when you go on your vacation just as long as you take control of your period and make sure that you are doing the right stuff and using the right stuff.

Read it cover to cover! By the way: It does not just apply to women.  I have been there, so I sympathize, and I will tell you it is a long tough road. Candida thrives in an acidic environment.  The American Diet is 80% acidic, 20% alkaline typically.  In order to get healthy those percentages need to be turned to 20% acidic, 80% alkaline! What are acidic foods? All white flours and sugars, everything processed and made with corn syrup, dextrose, sucrose.  You have to AVOID these at all costs! What is alkaline? Healthy foods!  Fruits, veggies, meats, whole grains.  Candida thrives in an acidic environment.  What is the best cure?  FOUR THINGS:  WILD MOUNTAIN OREGANO OIL, LOTS OF FRESH CHOPPED GARLIC, AND GRAPEFRUIT SEED EXTRACT, and PH balance pills (VAXA makes these). Don't forget to drink plenty of pure water. WHILE TAKING THESE FOUR REMEDIES, MAKE SURE YOU EAT PLENTY OF ACIDOPHILIS (YOGURT, ACIDOPHILIS PILLS).  IT IS NEEDED TO REPLACE THE GOOD BACTERIA IN YOUR SYSTEM.  WHEN CANDIDA OCCURS, THE BAD BACTERIA HAS OVERTAKEN THE GOOD, CAUSING FAR REACHING PROBLEMS.  TIREDNESS, MOOD SWINGS, ALLERGIES, SKIN PROBLEMS, MEMORY LOSS, CHRONIC FATIGUE, THE LIST IS ENDLESS.  CANDIDA CAN ALSO MIMIC THE SYMPTOMS OF OTHER DISEASES.  It also does not disappear overnight.  Sometimes an individual does not see improvement for a few months, and will have die off symptoms before they feel better.  Stick with the restrictive diet, and remember when you cheat, the bad bacteria is allowed to grow again, because CANDIDA LIVES ON SUGAR (THE HERB STEVIA IS A LIFESAVER IF YOU NEED A SUGAR REPLACEMENT IT IS 300X SWEETER THAN SUGAR AND IS NATURAL) Stay away from Nutrasweet, saccharin, Splenda-these are all chemicals that will cause more problems!!  One more thing:  If you have Candida, chances are you have a parasite problem as well.  Be sure to do a parasite cleanse also.  Parasites can also cause far reaching problems.\n"

Each mineral is composed of a specific molecular compound, and those molecules arrange themselves in an ordered fashion based on their structure that will form a crystal.  \\n\\nThese regular and repeating groups of molecules and atoms form a unit that is known as a lattice. There are 14 lattice groups (Bravais lattices), which fall into six (some crystallographers use seven) different crystal systems. Each crystal system includes the different rotation and reflection symmetries around a fixed lattice point. \\n\\nTo make this all more confusing, and to the horror of most mineralogy students there are also 32 different crystal classes. Each crystal class is a different and unique set of symmetrical forms.\\n\\nTo see illustrations of Bravais Lattices go here:\\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/bravais.html\\n\\nFor a more detailed explanation go here:\\nhttp://dave.ucsc.edu/myrtreia/crystal.html#INTRO\n"

I am looking for methods to reduce the swelling in order for her to get activated.\nAnswer: There are a couple ways to do this, but they won't be cure-alls; just helps.  \\n\\nIbuprofen (Advil) is an NSAID, or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.  As the description says, it has anti-inflammatory (anti-swelling) properties, and it will help with pain.  More than likely, any other meds you are giving her do not contain ibuprofen or aspirin, but if they do, I wouldn't use this.\\n\\nBenadryl (Diphenhydramine) has properties which stop the body from reacting to irritants; that's why they use it for rashes, poison ivy, etc.  This would help as well, although it'll probably make her tired.  Diphenhydramine is the exact same drug used in the sleep aid Sominex.  (Yeah, Benadryl and Sominex are the same drug - rip off, eh?  Buy whichever is cheaper...actually, buy the cheap-o generics if they're available -- there really is no difference whatsoever.)\\n\\nThat's about all I can think of over the counter.  Other people may have good ideas as well, and I'd trust the advice of your doctor over anything you read on here.\\n\\nI'd use coldpacks, but I'd stay away from using heat; it dilates the blood vessels and may make the pain worse.  Heat is best for muscular pain.\\n\\nP.S. - Her age matters, too.  If we're talking about an infant here, I would go ONLY by the advice of your doctor.\n"

What is another property besides diffraction, dispersion, refraction, and reflection? Please give a scientific answer.\nAnswer: All these produce a change in path of incident ray of light but reasons and effects are different in each:\\n\\nDiffraction -- bending of light round the edges and corners, while passing through slits/holes/wires in the same medium. produces a pattern of alternate bands/fringes ( minimum/maximum intensity). they are maximum intense at the center of the path and fades of - on both the sides\\nshape of bands/fringes depends on the shape of obstacle(hole/slit/wire/edge)\\n\\nRefraction -  bending of light , when it passes from one medium to another of a different refractive index, no pattern produced. no change in the intensity if the second medium does not reflect/absorb part of incident light.\\n\\nReflection: Change of path of light ray due to reflection, i.e the reflected ray is in the same medium as the second medium simply does neither absorbs nor allows it to pass through it. No change in the intensity and no pattern produced.\\n\\ndispersion -  splitting of incident lightray into its constituent wavelengths, when it passes through a medium (like prism). every wavelength gets deviated from incident path through a different angle (angle of dispersion), hence you can see different colors of visible light.\n"

They are a small part of a person's immune system.  They do not serve to prevent infections from going into the lungs.  There is a significant amount of \"tonsil\" tissue that is left in place on the back portion of the tongue when tonsils are removed.

        "sentence": "Question: What is emphysema and what are its causes?\nAnswer: Q. What is Emphysema?\\nFAQ\\n\\nFrom Stacey Lloyd,\\nYour Guide to Lung Diseases.\\n\\nA.\\n\\nEmphysema is a lung disease in which the walls of the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs fracture or burst. As these alveoli break, the remaining alveoli become enlarged to make up for the loss. This results in a fewer number of alveoli, with many enlarged. \\nWhen alveoli are enlarged, they loose their elasticity. A loss of elasticity in the alveoli results in the inability to eliminate air from the lungs. Therefore, patients must use force (energy) to expel this air. \\n\\nFurthermore, the loss of elasticity in the lungs affects the smaller bronchial tubes. To push air out of the bronchial tubes, a higher pressure must be developed inside the chest. \\n\\nThis higher pressure tends to collapse the smaller bronchial tubes, making it even more difficult to empty air from the alveoli. \\nCoughing becomes very difficult and ineffective in expelling mucus, leaving the lungs more susceptible to lung infections, such as pneumonia. \\n\\n( http://lungdiseases.about.com/od/emphysema/f/emphysema_expl.htm )\\n\\nWhat causes emphysema?\\nEmphysema can be caused by one or a combination of these things:\\n\\nCigarette smoking: Most cases of emphsyema are caused by cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoke reaches deep into the lungs and causes permanent damage. If you have emphysema from cigarettes, the best way to stop your lung damage is to quit smoking as soon as possible. It's never too late to quit smoking. \\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency: Some people have emphsyema because of a rare genetic disorder called Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency. People with Alpha-1 are missing an enzyme that protects their lungs. Some people with Alpha-1 deficiency get emphysema without ever having smoked. Other people get emphsyema from the combination of smoking and having Alpha-1 deficiency. \\nAir pollution: There is some evidence that air pollution can contribute to people getting emphysema, especially if the person also smokes.

        "sentence": "Question: What unwritten laws were the Nazis punished for at Nuremeberg?\nAnswer: The Nazis weren's punished for breaching unwritten laws. The restriction of trial and punishment by the international tribunal to personnel of the Axis countries has led to accusations of victor's justice and that Allied war crimes could not be tried. However it is usual that the armed forces of a civilised country  issue their forces with detailed guidance on what is and is not permitted under their military code. These are drafted to include any international treaty obligations and the customary laws of war. For example at the trial of Otto Skorzeny his defence was in part based on the Field Manual published by the War Department of the United States Army, on 1 October 1940, and the American Soldiers' Handbook.\\n\\n The unconditional surrender of the Axis powers was unusual and led directly to the formation of the international tribunals. Usually international wars end conditionally and the treatment of suspected war criminals makes up part of the peace treaty. In most cases those who are not prisoners of war are tried under their own judicial system if they are suspected of committing war crimes – as happened the end of the concurrent Continuation War and led to the war-responsibility trials in Finland. In restricting the international tribunal to trying suspected Axis war crimes, the Allies were acting within normal international law.\\n\\nThe legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939.\n"

Moderate drinking doesn’t kill brain cells but helps the brain function better into old ageOf course, years of alcohol abuse can cause serious neurological damage, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Harm can be done to message-carrying dendrites on neurons in the cerebellum, a part of the brain involved in learning and physical coordination. But even in such extreme cases, there’s a lack of evidence that alcohol kills brain cellsHowever, abstinence after chronic alcohol abuse enables brains to repair themselves, according to new research involving rats.People who drink too much and are thinking about either reducing or eliminating their drinking should find these findings encouraging, although humans have not yet been tested directly for the positive brain effects\n"

I tend to send clients the route less traveled as you have a better chance of getting picked up.  Most say you need an agent, and yes that is true if you want to be published by Powerhouse or other Large Publishing company.  However, they often pass on great books because they have so many in progress.  I manage writers, poets, models, and musicians. For all my writers I send them to small publishing houses first. I currently have a client and friend signed to YinSumi Press (www.yinsumi.com) at first I was hesistant to send her but they gave the best long term deal.  It is ran by people who have worked in the entertainment industry for over 15 years. So they already have her doing speaking engagements and her book doesn't go to press until August. Plus she will earn more than the larger publishing house was offering her.  They are a small publshing house with all the connections of a large publishing house. You might want to check them out. But if you do choose to go to a large publishing house, please get an agent and be patient, it may take years before anyone picks up your story.\n"

When I stopped eating it went away. Everytime I eat this happens. Always clears up after I stop. Prett much figured out this was a salivary gland infection. I started taking amoxicilin. Doesn't seem to have helped much. What can I do and is there some kind of relief for the pain while eating meanwhile?\nAnswer: You probably have a small blockage in your saliva glands (much like a kidney stone). When you eat, saliva production increases, and the blockage creates pain in the glands.\n"

Then dividing by 3 takes the cube root of that.  So averaging the values is the arithmetic average and averaging the logs is the geometric average.  Which one is fits what you're doing best?  You'll have to figure that out.  I'd guess the geometric average based on the formula you've given.\n"

Let's take the issue of abortion: Pro-Choice means that whether or not the person in question agrees with the idea of abortion, and personally, I'm not too keen on it, they recognize the descision is not theirs to make. The name \"Pro-Abortion\" is moreso AoN; the message conveyed is either you're on the side that rejects abortion or the side that wants all women to have abortions. Same with Gun Control. Personally, I side with the right on this, due to the fact that anything can be used to kill someone, even one's bare hands. Making handguns illegal isn't going to do anything except a possible decrease in homicide concerning firearms alone, assuming that the offenders in question abide by the gun laws: the thing that makes a criminal a criminal is that they do not obey the laws, therefore would not abide by a gun law. Comments?\nAnswer: Hi..I think all or nothing means your in or your not..no matter the house.\\nAs for Pro-choice..it doesn't mean for all the women..it just gives them the option.This could be decided upon a number of things...one being pregnant after a rape..a drunken one night stand..a nasty stepdad..you pick the scenario...they have the choice.\\nAs for the gun issue..if everyone is allowed to have one(legally)less the felons stricter by law thus harder to get..crime may actually go down when assuming the one you may rob could easily defend theirself..or the house you may break into may be packed to the gil.Of course offenders would not abide ,but if the citizens were equally equiped, that little thing called hesitation may result in a bigger thing called thought.It may just result in a big shoot out but if it does..I hope I don't just have a table to hide behind..and if I ever get raped..I hope I can choose whether or not to carry the rapist's child.\n"

At time t = 0, the reference lines of the two disks have the same orientation. Disk A is already rotating, with a constant angular velocity of 9.5 rad/s. Disk B has been stationary but now begins to rotate at a constant angular acceleration of 2.2 rad/s2. (a) At what time t will the reference lines of the two disks momentarily have the same angular displacement θ ? (b) Will that time t be the first time since t = 0 that the reference lines are momentarily aligned?\nAnswer: The equations of motion for the angular displacement of each disk are given by:\\n\\nDisk A: R1(t) = (1/2)*alpha1*t² + w1*t +Ri1\\nDisk B: R2(t) = (1/2)*alpha2*t² + w2*t +Ri2\\n\\nFor part (a), we're looking for the time, T, for which R1(T) = R2(T)\\n\\n(1/2)*alpha1*T² + w1*T +Ri1 = (1/2)*alpha2*T² + w2*T +Ri2\\n\\nFrom the problem statement, we obtain the following information:\\n\\nRi1 = Ri2\\nalpha1 = 0\\nw1 = 9.5 rad/s\\nalpha2 = 2.2 rad/s²\\nw2 = 0\\n\\nSubstituting these values and simplifying, we obtain:\\n\\nw1*T= (1/2)*alpha2*T²\\n\\nw1= (1/2)*alpha2*T\\n\\nT = 2*w1 / (alpha2)\\n\\nT = 2(9.5 rad/s) / (2.2 rad/s²)\\n\\nT = 8.64 s\\n\\nTechnically, part (b) is impossible to say without knowing how the reference line is defined, but I'll give it a whirl. If the reference line is measured from the center of each disk to its outer edge, then yes.\\n\\nHowever, if the reference line is placed across the diameter of the disk, then no. In this case, the reference lines will be aligned when the angular displacement of Disk A is 180° or pi radians ahead of Disk B. To solve for this time, simply add pi to Disk B's equation of motion:\\n\\n(1/2)*alpha1*T² + w1*T +Ri1 = (1/2)*alpha2*T² + w2*T +Ri2 + pi\\n\\nSubstituting out known values again leads us to:\\n\\nw1*T= (1/2)*alpha2*T² + pi\\n\\nor:\\n\\n(1/2)*alpha2*T² - w1*T + pi = 0\\n\\n1.1*T² - 9.5*T + pi = 0\\n\\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that \\n\\nT = .344 seconds or 8.292 seconds\\n\\nThus, if the reference line is directed across the entire disk, then they are momentarily aligned twice before having the same angular displacement.\\n\\n(This added after a while)\\n{BTW, monohan47130 - no I didn't. Please read what I wrote. If the reference lines are defined along the radius only, then you are correct - there is only one point at which the disks have the same angular displacement. But, reference lines are typically made along the entire circle (diameter). This means that they will be aligned 3 times total in 8.64 seconds :) }\n"

I want to do it, its just that im kinda scared. This is normal right? Help with this?\nAnswer: Congratulations! well, let's see... you should probably be the one who initiate the move of holding hands first. You can do that by asking her if she's cold? and take her hand and warm them up and dont let go? it's chessy but it works! and take things slow. if you are going to give her a hug, don't rush into the hug... make sure you see where her head and arms are... you don't want to bump into her like an idiot... give her kisses on her hands, then cheeks then watever... but like I said, take it slow and be aware of where you are and who's watching.. make sure she's in a comfortable environment. don't worry about it, this is what makes being in a relationship fun! goodo luck\n"

        "sentence": "Title: Ex Smokers....How did you quit? What worked/didn't work for you?\nQuestion: I have a friend who has been smoking for 12 years. She really wants to quit but struggles so badly with the psychological addiction. She has tried patches, gum and the tablet from the docs(cant remember the name). \\n\\nAny advice from people who have \"been there, done that\" would be appreciated.\nAnswer: I smoked for 11 years at it wasn't easy to quit.  What I found worked best was to make a list of all the time throughout the day when you usually have a smoke.  Take a good look at the list and decide which one you don't 'need'.  Cut that one out and do it for a week.  Then take another look at the list and cut another one.  Keep going as long as you have to to get down to none.  By the time you get to one, you usually have enough confidence in yourself to look at it and think \"I don't need this - it's not worth it.\"  It took me 11 weeks to quit that way because my average intake was 11 cigarettes (just over half a pack) a day.  By doing it this way, I didn't feel deprived because I knew my next smoke was just a few hours away.  I hadn't quit cold turkey and I made the decision as to which one to cut out and when.  It gave me a great feeling of empowerment.  I know it sounds like it would take forever this way, but slow and steady really does win the race.\\n\\nBest of luck!\n"
