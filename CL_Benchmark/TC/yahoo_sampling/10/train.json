So any electricity you put into the lake would leave immediately. Thus, you would have to put a tremendous amount of power all at once.

The most spectacular rainbow displays when half of the sky is still dark with draining clouds and the observer is at a spot with clear sky overhead. The rainbow effect is also commonly seen near waterfalls or fountains. Rainbow fringes can sometimes be seen at the edges of backlit clouds and as vertical bands in distant rain or virga.

I am and how I am raising my son wrong...\\n\\nI just would liek to understand.\nAnswer: I am not liberal or a conservative, but I do think that it is wrong to teach children that there is a difference in peoples sexual preferences.  Children at that age should not know anything about what adults do.  I know it is hard to keep them from hearing everything, but there is no reason to put it right in front of them.  The schools should teach acceptance of all people despite race, gender, etc.  I think that in this day and age it is hard for us to protect our children from all the harsh realities of life.  Your son will be exposed to this at some point in the future but it is up to you to teach him what you want him to know.  And, you have to be ready for your child to make his own decision on how he feels when he is older.  His best friend may end up being gay or something you don't like.  I think that you have every right to raise your son how you want to, but you need to be ready for him to rebel in some way, or to just not have the same convictions as you.  I know that my parents are proud of me even though I don't have the same beliefs as they do.  My parents never tried to force their beliefs on me, but they did try to influence my decision by telling me what they thought was right.  \\n \\nDon't try to understand the agends of the political world.  The basic thing is to make the other guy look bad so you will always look good.  It is all a bunch of crap anyway.  Go with your feelings and forget the rest of the junk.\\n\\n\\nI would also like to ask a question:  Why does being gay have to be an issue?  Is a gay person not still a person just because he is gay?  Why do we have to fight over gay rights?  I thought that as a person we already had all the rights we needed to be allowed to live.  \" the right to life, liberty, and the persute of happiness\"  How does being gay change those rights?  If being gay is what makes a person happy then they have the right to be gay without being treated differently.\n"

Lemoore, California.  Lemoore has highest ratio of made 3 point shots in central section, Alex has highest ratio at Lemoore High School.  5'9\" 160lbs.  3.5gpa\nAnswer: Believe it or not, the coaches usually come to you -- early.  I know a 15-year-old, 6'3\" high school basketball star who started receiving letters from universities as a freshman.  This was before he was invited to join the varsity basketball team as a freshman.  In short, Big Ten university coaches have been courting him and his parents since he was 14.\\n\\nSince your star has not been approached at this point, you must take matter into your own hands.  Despite the height factor, treat your star like a product.  Become your own Arliss or Jerry Maguire, i.e., sports agent.  Look at the college sports pages for top twenty lists to map out your target schools.  Assemble a media kit with the newspaper clippings, high school transcripts, a personal essay, letters of recommendation from faculty and community leaders, and action photographs of your star.  Pitch your star to the head coach and assistant coaches.  If they require more information, offer to send them a media kit.  Request an interview.  If possible try to bring your star to meet the coach if his/her team is playing at a nearby university.  Send a thank you note.\\n\\nIf that does not work, network, network, network ... Cultivate relationships with the sports writers at your local and big city newspapers and the sports anchors of your local television networks.  Ask for help.  Then ask for recommendations.  For the most part, if your star is not on the front page of the sports section, then you must be aggressive in gaining coverage.  \\n\\nAdditional keys to boosting the profile of your star are park districts, regional tournaments, traveling teams, basketball festivals, and summer camps.  The more people know about the talents of your star, the better.  It may sound overwhelming (and expensive), but practice and multiple performance venues make perfect public relations for budding NCAA stars.  If your star has not been playing basketball year-round, since kintergarten, then expedite your media campaign -- yesterday.\\n\\nIf your star is really a star, then a scholarship is in your reach.  So, roll up your sleeves and claim it.  Ask the basketball coach, athletic director, principal and teachers for support in your endeavor because the universities will confirm your information.\\n\\nAgain, year-round participation is of vital importance.  So, research leagues outside of high school.\\n\\nHave a grateful day.\n"

        "sentence": "Title: pesonal question?\nQuestion: how can i shave my pusssy without getting the itching feeling after the shave?should i use hair removing cream or shaving equipment?\nAnswer: \"Shave at the end of the shower or after the hair has been wet at least five minutes.  Hair that is wet through and through cuts like butter, a good razor blade will cut through it smoothly and effortlessly.  Hair that is not completely wet, however, can be as strong as reinforced concrete.  Cutting through such tough hair often causes hairs to be pulled up from their follicles as they are being cut.  These hairs then retract below the flush surface of skin where they are at risk for curving back into the skin as they grow rather than out through the follicle.  The forces required to cut such hair also can translate into more friction on the skin that can promote irritation.\\n\\nShave with downward strokes. (Go with the grain.)  Shaving in the same direction that the hair lies (typically down) will result in less pull on the hairs and less tendency to cut them too short.  Hairs cut too short are at risk of curling into the skin while growing and causing razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  Shaving with the grain will also minimize skin irritation.\\n\\nMinimize repeat shaving strokes.  Think of shaving as equivalent to mowing the lawn.  Not only is it a waste of time and energy in each case to go over and over the same area, but repeated shaving or mowing may result in things being cut too short.  On the skin, repeated shaving strokes increase the risk of ingrown hairs and skin irritation.  It is best to shave with just enough overlap to avoid skipping areas.\\n\\nShave with the skin in a neutral relaxed position.  This is the best way to shave hair close but not too close.  Sometimes the skin must be stretched very slightly to allow the razor to pass smoothly without nicking.  Excessive tightening of the skin when shaving, however, tends to result in hairs being shaved below the resting surface of the skin. This occurs because as the skin is stretched tight the hairs actually protrude out a bit farther than when the skin is relaxed.  Shaving over stretched skin may cut the hairs below the flush surface of resting skin, increasing the risk of ingrown hairs and also increasing the risk of skin irritation.\"\n"

        "sentence": "Title: Does it follow: If abortion is illegal, government can come into our bedroom or force us to get pregnant?\nQuestion: Consider: Governments, such as in China, currently force women to have abortions, become sterilized, or contracept. They allow only ONE CHILD per family! Abortion is not only legal there but dictated by population control groups and government officials who accept this ideology. If a \"woman's right to choose\" to kill her child is withdrawn how does this give any government the authority or power to tell you \"when or if you should get pregnant?\" It seems to me that \"the government came into our bedroom\" when nine Supreme Court judges (men!) ruled on the abortion issue in 1973. Prior to that WE were voting on whether we wanted abortion legal in each state. Our government ENDED that vote! Furthermore, I suggest that sexuality is not a \"private\" matter in the first place because it involves not only the TWO persons who copulate, but the whole family who cares about and supports them (as well as friends, church, etc.). In Hilary Clinton's infamous words \"it takes a village to raise a child.\" Another factor is that abortion is about ending a life (even if you don't consider that life a person) and \"the bedroom\" concerns beginning a life, the latter of which no one has proposed need be regulated... EXCEPT anti-population advocates who also support abortion! So isn't the real issue not what governments will do in our bedrooms but should they protect all human life or not? Do we allow any other type of murder in our bedrooms? Instead we should also ask ourselves, why not make it legal to kill our post-born children when we allow our pre-born to be killed? Shouldn't we be consistent in our arguments? I suspect a prolife government is better than an anti-life government just as surely as a prolife doctor is better than one who deals death. Right?\nAnswer: NO, not right.  Your question is conveluted and misses the point completely.  I can't even respond becuase your conclusions come from no real reasoning.  The tall and skinny of it is this: our governement is not anti-life.  It is pretty clearly pro-life, and anti-abortion.  Consider the fact that there is currently a third trimester partial birth abortion ban.  This is the only kind of abortion that the Supreme Court has said would be acceptable to ban completely.  And the FEDERAL government did this.  It is not a people or a state issue.  It is no business of the government's what I do with my uterus - I would never presume to tell you or Ms. Rice what to do with yours, so stay the hell away from mine.  The fact is abortion is not a form of murder (argue it all you want, I am talking legally) , so your argument that we can't comitt murder in our bedroom blah blah really doesn't follow.  This is a privacy issue - the Supreme Court has held that our Constitution protects privacy interests in our own homes in many many different ways.  I suggest you consider the fact that this posting board ONLY exists becuase the Constition provides a free speech protection.  The government cannot come in and tell you not to express your opinion (thought the Bush White House apparently feels this doesn't apply to them...).  Get off your crazy high horse, your argument is so off and so full of misunderstings its not even funny.\n"

How did all populations of humans advance at the same time?\nQuestion: For approximately 150-200,000 years, humans essentially lived like very smart animals, then fairly suddenly, about 10,000 years ago, we all seemed to have discovered agriculture and \"civilization\"..a few thousand years later we were all writing.  I have never seen a decent, logical explanation for how all the populations of the Earth took this \"great leap forward\" at the same time-After 150-200,000 years, suddenly within about 1% of that time frame, there are cities everywhere from the Middle East, to China, to North and South America?  Writing starting independently everywhere?  For me, this is the most mysterious event in all of history-any ideas?\nAnswer: Hey! Your \"other\" question is already cluttered up with some high voltage discussion and nice arguements so, I thought I should post my answer here as it is more peaceful and calm here. I was wondering whether I should have posted my answer there? \\n\\nNow, I'll try to make sense while talking about a topic that I know little about. \\n\\n1- It all started with the arrival of the first bipedal- Australopithecus anamensis. (some might argue that it was Ardipithecus ramidus). Ok, the point is, as our ancestors started to learn to walk on two feet, they had some challenges to face as bipedalism reduced their speed considerably putting them at a clear disadvantage against their predators.\\nNow, as this problem was faced by all the hominids all over the world at the same time, it led to some parallel thoughts (and thus inventions and discoveries) all over the world e.g. building homes, making weapons and tools etc. (The stone tools were first made by the handy man i.e. Homo habilis and not Australopithecus).\\nThis tool technology was spread by Homo ergaster as they  migrated outside Africa.\\n\\n2- Then, in the course of evolution, the early humans started to have a complex cultural lives and they grew emotionally, e.g. the Neanderthals (who aren't our direct ancestors) started to bury the dead.\\n\\n3- As the homo species like homo erectus, homo neanderthalis, homo heidelbergenesis and ancient homo sapiens (Cro Magnon) made further advances in creativity and productivity, they all felt a natural need to pen down their thoughts. This led to the cave painitngs and carvings. All of those paintings can be interpreted as diary entries as you may see that the paintings and carvings simply depict what the early men \"did\" i.e. hunting, using tools etc.\\nSo, I guess it is understandable why the \"pictorial-scripts\" developed contemporarily to each other.\\n\\n4- But the question still remains: Why were the origin of world's ancient scripts so contemporary to each other? I guess, as man found the pictorial depiction of thoughts and emotions more and more unconvenient and tedious due to the diverseness of thoughts and situations to be depicted, it started taking help of symbols. Perhaps, this behaviour was so \"human-like\" that every sub-species of the homo sapiens followed this pattern of 'depicting thoughts symbolically' universally.\\n\\n5- Another reason of this might be migration. Before the ancient civilizations like Inka, Mesopotamia, Egyptian etc. even came into existence, the early hominids led a nomadic life. According to the \"Out of Africa Hypothesis\", all the modern humans \"Homo Sapiens\" originated from Africa. Later, they migrated to Africa, Asia and Europe and formed groups.\\nSo, I guess due to their similar ancestral origins, the human beings had a common problem solving approach and hence, attempted the problem of inconvenience of pictorial scripts in a nearly identical manner.\\n\\nThe scientific difference in the scripts can explain that they were devised on completely different grounds but, the approach was similar due to common origins and creative grounds.\n"

The slope is (-delta H degrees)/(R) and the intercept will be (delta S degrees)/ (delta G).  Delta G degrees can then be determined at any temperature of  interest.  \\n\\nThe graph of my information gives me a slope of -5348.5 and a y-intercept of 12.614.  \\n\\nHow is the graph used to evaluate delta H?\nAnswer: R is the gas constant (= 8.31 J/mol*K).  The value should be with the list of constants in your book.\\n\\nOk Nic, you seem to be a bit confused on this issue so lets go back and start from scratch.\\n\\nFirst you obtained you values for T and K (experimentally or otherwise).  MAKE SURE YOU CONVERT YOUR TEMP VALUES TO KELVIN.  It's important for the units of the constant (R) are in Kelvin.  So then you calculate 1/T and lnK and plot the values for each set to generate your graph.\\n\\nYou calculate slope by taking two of your points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).  From the data you added, let's say we'll use your first (0.002976, -3.079) and last points (0.003165, -4.225).\\n\\nslope= [-4.225- (-3.079)]/[0.003165-0.002976]= -6063.49 kelvin\\n\\nSince slope = -delta H/R\\nThen -delta H = slope * R\\nSo -delta H = -6063.49kelvin * 8.31 J/molkelvin\\nAnd -delta H= -50387.62 J/mol\\nRemoving the negatives from both sides\\nDelta H= 50387.62 J/mol\\n\\nFor the second part of the question, use one (x,y) experimental point to find the y-intercept.  They don't want you to determine it from your plot, they want you to calculate the exact value.\\n\\nThe equation of a line is y=mx+b where \"m\" is the slope and \"b\" is the intercept.  So take another experimental point from readings (ie 0.003012, -3.751) and calculate the intercept by using the slope value calculated above.\\n\\nIf y=mx+b, then b= y-mx\\nPlugging in the values\\nb= -3.751 - (-6063.49kelvin * 0.003012/kelvin)\\nb= -3.751 - (-18.26)\\nb= 14.51\\n\\nTo calculate delta S for that same point (for that's what is requested), first you have to calculate delta G for that point.  Use the  following equation;\\n\\ndelta G = -RTlnK\\n\\nYou know the value for R (8.31 J/molkelvin), and you have the temp value and lnK value for that point for it was expermientally determined\\n\\n1/T= 0.003012/kelvin so T=332.01 kelvin\\nlnK= -3.751\\n\\nSo delta G= -8.31 J/molkelvin * 332.01 kelvin * -3.751\\nand delta G = 10349.02 J/mol\\n\\nYou can then calculate delta S for\\nintercept = delta S/ delta G (given in your original data)\\n\\nTherefore delta S = intercept * delta G\\nSo delta S = 14.51 * 10349.02 J/mol = 150164.28 J/mol\\n\\nHope this clarifies things.\n"

I have a choice to read it for extra credit, should I?\nAnswer: Reviews and Commentary\\n(http://www.petehautman.com/invisibleinfo.html)  \\n\\nLIBRARY JOURNAL (starred review) \\n\\nSeventeen-year-old Dougie takes everything literally, lacks social graces and is a loner, except, perhaps, for his one friend, athletic and popular Andy Morrow. But readers know almost immediately that something tragic has happened in the recent past: ' Andy and I had some bad luck with fires when we were kids. We're more careful now.' Other students feel threatened by Dougie's disturbing behavior and react by targeting him with cruelty and violence, which only serves to escalate his descent into unreality, isolation, and obsession. The teen has been working for nearly three years on his model railroad set, using 22, 400 headless matches to build a bridge connecting portions of the 'Madham Line.' As his life deteriorates, this obsession and his nightly talks with Andy are the only things that keep him clinging to normalcy. He resists the help of his psychiatrist and hides his medication. Ultimately, he is forced to remember what actually happened on that fateful night. With its excellent plot development and unforgettable, heartbreaking protagonist, this is a compelling novel of mental illness. \\n\\n  \\n\\nHORN BOOK (starred review) \\n\\nGifted in math, and recognizably clever when constructing architectural models (he's building an elaborate railroad system in his basement), Doug reveals that it's human interaction he can't figure out. \"I'm a quiet kid, pretty much invisible,\" he says in a precise, unemotional voice, as this unreliable narrator begins his story. Invisibility is Doug's rationale for explaining a range of rejection, from teacher irritation to peer scorn, particularly from pretty and popular Melissa Haverman, who is disgusted by what readers will recognize as Doug's stalker behavior. But Doug reports one near-perfect relationship, the one he has with his best friend, Andy. Gradually, however, that friendship is revealed to be not what it seems. There are secrets from their past that Doug won't discuss, and hints from their present life that skew his tale. Why is there a strange man in Andy's house? What fuels Doug's increasingly complex rendering of their intertwined initials? What medication is Doug refusing to take? Reading this psychological thriller is much like putting together one of Doug's railroad bridges: connections are being made, but the realities being built may be imitations of life rather than the real thing. The tension comes from entering Doug's private hell and learning what put him there. \\n\\n  \\n\\nPUBLISHERS WEEKLY (starred review) \\n\\nThe strength of Hautman's painfully sad novel is the wisecracking but clearly unreliable voice of its narrator, 17-year-old Douglas MacArthur Hanson who admits, \"I'm not only disturbed, I'm obsessed.\" One of his passions is \"Madham,\" a town he's building for his model railroad, complete with a 1:800 scale replica of the Golden Gate Bridge. He's also fixated on a pretty girl who clearly wants nothing to do with him. And he's overly reliant on his only friend, Andy Morrow, a fellow junior who is the popular and outgoing yang to Dougie's outcast and introverted yin. Hautman expertly teases out the truth about a tragic incident that occurred \"at the Tuttle place\" three years earlier, a mystery that propels the story to its horrific conclusion. Dougie is as mathematically gifted and socially inept as the autistic narrator of Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, but he also has a sophisticated wit. During a lapse in conversation at one of his $95-an-hour therapy sessions, he observes, \"We stare at each other for about $1.40.\" His self-deprecating comments and wry observations make his spiral into self destruction all the more heartbreaking.

They could be in a transition in life: New city, inbetween jobs, lonely, just lost a loved one, just broke up with someone.  People are often lied to at first before they get in the group.  They get people to attend meetings under false pretenses.  The cult leaders put phobias against quitting in peoples minds.  Cults can provide an instant family and social approval for people.

We werent there for the events that took place so why are they acting like it. Im i the only one that thinks this?\nAnswer: According to The American Consumer, people who identify themselves as being 'Liberal on most or all issues' are likely to spend time online than those on the other end of the spectrum (upwards of 40% more hours per week)  So, that's the reason.  More Liberals on the Net translates to more liberals on Yahoo! Answers, a portal of the world's largest media company (and therefore, very reflective of over-all netizen demographics).  Wasn't it refreshing to just get a factual answer instead of a diatribe :)  Oh, but out of curiosity what 'events that took place' were you referring to?

        "sentence": "Question: I would like to know can i be exposed to hepatitis c?\nAnswer: In truth, the risk of transmission to co-workers or other household members seems to be quite low, and even sexual transmission is rare. The CDC recommends the use of sexual prophylactics by anyone infected with hepatitis C or any other sexually transmissible disease, but common contact is not dangerous. While it should be kept in mind that there is no known mode of transmission for approximately 10% of cases, this should not be taken as a statement that it can be easily casually acquired. Routine precautions around blood, and avoiding the sharing of toothbrushes, razors, and other personal items should provide adequate protection.\\n\\n\\n\\nA number of agents can cause hepatitis, including infectious diseases, chemical poisons, drugs and alcohol. Hepatitis C is a contagious viral disease that leads to serious, permanent liver damage, and in many cases, death.\\n IV drug users represent the largest single risk group.  Sexual contact has been clearly identified as a means of transmitting hepatitis C.  Household contact with another household member that has hepatitis C has also been strongly implicated, and this, in combination with heterosexual exposure, is believed to be responsible for approximately 13% of all infections.  Around 2% of all cases of hepatitis C are thought to be contracted through the occupational risk (needle-stick injuries, blood spills, etc) involved with the health care profession.\\n\\nPrisoners have enormous incidence of infection - rates reported in some California prisons exceed 80%, with certain institutions reporting nearly 100% of their prisoners infected.\\n\\nSome skin piercing practices, notably tattooing, body piercing, and acupuncture, have contributed significantly to the spread of HCV, particularly in less industrialized nations. Tattooing in particular poses a serious risk. Even in the presence of good sterilization, studies have suggested that the ink used in tattooing can become contaminated and transmit the virus.\\n\\nCocaine users have an abnormally high risk of infection due to the fact that they frequently share snorting straws, which may have small amounts of blood-carrying mucous on them. \\n\\nLess obvious, specialized risk factors have been identified resulting from indirect exposures to blood - including manicures, shared toothbrushes and razors, and straight razors in barber shops.\\n\\nIn many surveys, about a third of people who are alcoholics are also infected with the HCV virus.\n"
