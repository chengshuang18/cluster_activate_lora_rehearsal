Does anyone know anything that would help her?\\nShe has constant pain in her legs mostly the right as over thelast few years she has fallen and broken the rt. leg about ten yrs ago and it healed crooked  Any ideas out there?\nAnswer: In its most general terms, neuropathy refers to a disorder of the peripheral nerves (the nerves in our legs, arms, etc.).  Neuropathy can be a chronic, painful, and often debilitating condition where the nerve experiences chronic inflammation and/or dysfunctions.  There are serveral types/causes of neuropathy including:\\n1. Diabetes\\n2. Alcoholism\\n3. Chronic nerve compression in the spine\\n4. History of crush injury\\n5. ...or even without a known cause, or idiopathic.\\n\\nStandard treatments usually include management of diabetes (in diabetic neuropathy) and use of medications which depress excitation of the nervous system such as neurontin or Lyrica. Unfortunately, these medications usually come with some hefty side effects.\\n\\nAnodyne therapy is a realtively new therapy, but there is still much to be learned about this.  It's a treatment usually performed by a physical therapist that uses monochormatic infrared light waves to stimulate blood flow to the nerves.  It is usually used as part of a comprehensive program of Anodyne, gait and balance training in order to reduce pain and increase function/quality of life.  \\n\\nFirst step is for her to consult with her primary physician or a neurologist.\n"

If you could solve that problem, then the result MIGHT depend on the yield of the weapon... but it would have to be a few million times stronger than today's strongest weapons, since the immense molten iron core of the earth handles pressures and forces far in excess of anything we will ever experience, and probably stronger than anything we could ever create in the next five thousand years.

I had set up an account a year and a half ago during the first week my school was on there and then spent 8 hours that first day making my profile, looking up friends (both new and old), and looking up random people from my school.  It was then that I realized how much time I wasted and how addictive it was so I closed my account that same day.  All of my friends are on it and are telling me to get it since many of them are either graduating from college this year or go to schools in other states and say it helps to keep in touch.  I've been preaching against it and resisting the urge to join, but reconsidering now.  Let me know what you think. \\n\\nThanks...\\n\\nScott\nAnswer: It is indeed VERY addictive.  I have spent many hours on it.  BUT, that being said, I also find it to be a really great way to keep in touch with my friends from other schools!

Similarly, if they do welcome you, this means that are open-minded people who won't have an issue with your race since they didn't have a problem with your sexuality. So in short, no I dont think it is harder for non-caucasions, but I imagine it is equally hard for all gay men\n"

For a pumpkin, it depends on where you are - some cuisines use pumpkin in the sweet course (like pumpkin pie), while others use it as a savory side dish.\\n\\nBotanically speaking, it is a fruit. However, \"vegetable\" is not a term that is used at all in botany. It doesn't refer to a specific plant structure and all botanical terms specify what part of the plant the items comes from. \\n\\nSo if you are going to insist that a tomato is a fruit, you should also point out that zuchinni and okra are also fruit; spinach is a leaf; rhubarb and celery are stems; carrots, radishes, and turnips are roots; broccoli and cauliflower are both flowers and stems; nuts, grains and legumes are seeds; and potatoes are specialized stems called tubers.\n"

They have one of there best squads ever in there history. I also think they will advance with argentina out of the group stages, leaving holland behind, i agree with you comlpetely. argentina has more of a balanced team, so it will be tough for Ivory Coast to find a weak spot to attack, and they have Riquelme in the midfield who can dictate games and be a field general. Holland have some great player like Ruud Van Nistelrooy, but aren't as balanceed as Argentina, so i think ivory coast will be able to break them down much easier and win.

Each species of mammal has at least one kind of \"hair\" or fur. Many species have several different specialized types. For example, cat whiskers are very different from regular cat fur in texture and length. One of the main differences in hair is whether it is determinate in length (grows to a certain length and stops) or indeterminate in length (grows for as long as it is alive.) Humans have both kinds in different places on the body. Head hair, scalp and face, is indeterminate. Body hair, arms, underarms, legs, pubic area, fingers and toes is determinate. The only determinate hairs on the head are normal eyebrows, ear hair and nose hairs. I think the reason is obvious. \"Wild hairs\" are determinate hairs that have encountered a genetic failure. The length possibilities of each type of hair from sheep's wool to seal fur are genetically determined.  Pubic hair is a secondary sex characteristic that signals availability for mating. It is not designed to cover, conceal, protect, or warm the area that produces it. It may have some scent retaining or focusing function too. This is still debatable. I hope this helps.\n"

The circumstances of the terrorist attacks deserve the most serious and conscientious investigation. Both the Bush administration and the Democrats and Republicans in Congress have rejected any such probe, suggesting that to question the role of the FBI, CIA and other intelligence agencies is unpatriotic.\\n\\nBut the facts which are known so far point to the conclusion that officials at the highest levels of the US government knew that a major terrorist attack was under way and made no serious effort to prevent it. The political motive can be inferred: they permitted an attack to go forward—whether they knew its full dimensions or not—in order to provide the necessary pretext for carrying out a right-wing agenda of military intervention abroad and attacks on democratic rights at home.\n"

        "sentence": "Question: How to Seduce a Woman?\nAnswer: Seduce her mind first. You must get in her head and have her thinking about you. You must make her feel comfortable with you. \\nListen and talk to her. Women love to talk! They feel closer to you if you listen and remember what you talked about. In a way, words are a form of intercourse for a woman because it's the only thing they have with which to establish trust with you. A woman will tell you exactly how and when she wants to be seduced if you just shut up and listen to her. \\nTake things slowly. Show her that you're patient; your ability to resist her will make her wonder if you're really interested, and will motivate her to show you that she's worth being interested in. \\nKiss with your eyes first. Women need to feel a connection with you. You begin this connection through your words and then your eyes. If you can keep her eyes on yours, and hypnotize her with your words, you are halfway there. \\nIncrease the physical intimacy. You have to be careful with this one. Don't be eager or aggressive. Begin touching a woman with simple hugs, pats on the back, etc. Then gradually increase it by bringing her in closer...kiss with your eyes! Then move on to simple kisses (pecks). Again, take it slow. \\nTalk about sex or sexy things. At some point, begin to talk about sex...not between the two of you, but general experiences you've had. Once you inject the topic of sex, it will be on their mind when they think about you. With women, it's all about familiarity and safety. Talking about the act makes them more comfortable with the act. \\nTell a woman you want her. Pick the right time, but be clear that you want her (not in a cheesy way ['I want you baby'] but in a tender way). She needs to know you want a time and place for the act. Gauge her reaction. If she is ready, then plan on setting up the situation for it to happen. \\nWhen it's the right time, always ask for permission ('Is this okay?') and be ready to back off at any time if she is not ready. \\nRespect a woman at all times. She is not a piece of meat but a human being with feelings. If you are out to 'get some,' then you are not seducing a woman. You are merely an animal in heat. \\nFind a good form of interaction, one that works best for you. If you need time to think about what you're going to say, maybe email or IM will work best for you, at least to start. \\n\\n\\n\\nTips \\nAlways listen. \\nTalk to her frequently. The best approach is email. It gives you direct access to her head because you can be as intimate as you want and she can mull your words while you are not around. \\nKiss with your eyes -- establish that eye to eye contact and you will begin the intimacy process. \\nThis method works with men too except they don't like to talk as much. \\nDon't be creepy -- staring at the wrong times, seeming overly eager, or airing out your relationship past on the first date are all examples of the wrong way to seduce a woman. Relax, take it slow and be yourself (unless, of course, you are creepy). \\nBuild a \"buzz\" around yourself -- Women put a lot of stock in what their friends think of prospective suitors. If you want to date a particular girl, demonstrate your good qualities (e.g., sense of humor, good taste, charitable nature) around her friends. \\nThink before you speak. \\nWarnings \\nAlways use protection. \\nNever, ever have sex if a woman does not want to. Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't want to do. Never hit a woman. \\n\\n--------------------------\n"

Never did Athena wash her mighty arms before she drove the dust from the flanks of her horses - not even when, her armor all defiled with filth, she returned from the war with the lawless Giants; but far first she loosed from the car her horses’ necks, and in the springs of Oceanus washed the flecks of sweat, and from their mouths that champed the bit: cleansed the clotted foam. \\n\\nO come, daughters of Achaea, but bring not myrrh nor alabaster (I hear the whir of her axle now!); bring not, you companions of the Bath, for Pallas myrrh, nor alabaster (for Athena does not wear perfume), neither bring you a mirror: she is sure of her beauty. Not even when Paris judged the contest on mount Ida; the great Goddess looked not into orichale nor into the transparent flow of the river Simois, nor did Hera. But Aphrodite took the shining bronze and often altered and again altered the same lock. While my Goddess, after running a two-hundred stade course, like the twin Spartan stars on the banks of Eurotas, then did her simple annointments: oil from her olive tree, applied with skill; and the blush, my dear maidens, that ran up her body was like the color of the morning rose or the seed of the pomegranate. Therefore now also bring you only this masculine virgin oil, with which Castor and with which Hercules anoint themselves. And bring her a comb all of gold, that she may comb her hair, when she had anointed her glossy tresses. \\n\\nCome forth, Athena! This company pleasing to your heart awaits you, the maiden daughters of Acestor’s mighty sons. Athena, come, the ancient rite is begun, the shield of Diomedes is carried to Inachus, an Argive rite taught by Eumedes, your beloved priest who on a time, when he knew that the people were plotting and planning his death, fled with your holy image to the hill called Creion - and set you in rocks, you, O Goddess, on the rugged rocks, whose name is now the Pallatid rocks. \\n\\nCome forth, Athena, Sacker of Cities, Athena, helmeted in gold, Athena, who rejoices in the crash of horses and shields. Come. Today, the city will drink from small springs and fountains, but not from the river; girls will dip pitchers in Physadeia today, maidens will bear water from Amymone's pool where the daughter of Danaus lives. For, mingling his waters with gold and with flowers, the river Inachus will flow from his pastoral hills, bringing fair water for the Bath of Pallas Athena. But beware, O Pelasgian river, brim your eyes to the Queen: the man who sees Pallas, Keeper of Cities, naked, shall look on Argos for this the last time. Come, Lady Athena, and meanwhile I shall say somewhat unto these. The story is not mine but told by others. \\n\\nThere was a time in Thebes, my dears, Athena loved a nymph, loved her to distraction, loved her more than any other, the mother of Teiresias, Chariclo by name, and was never apart from her. When Athena drove her horses towards ancient Thespiae or towards Coroneia or to Haliartus, riding through the farmlands of the Boeotians - or toward Coroneia where her grove is heavy with incense, and her altars lie close to the river Curalius - often did the Goddess set the nymph upon her car and there was no dalliance of nymphs nor sweet ordering of dance, where Chariclo did not lead. \\n\\nYet even Chariclo did many tears await \nAnswer: Sure is confusing.\n"

Einstien come up with the equation E=mc2? how will it be ralative in dev. of a-bomb/fusion?\nAnswer: The E=mc^2 equations come from Einstein's theory of Special Relativity. Special Relativity concerns the laws of motion and observed properties when objects are travelling very close to the speed of light.\\n\\nSpecial relativity starts with two premises: the speed of light is constant for all observers, and the laws of physics are the same for all observers. However, observed properties are not necessarily the same.\\n\\nSay I flew past the Earth in a space ship travelling 99% the speed of light. To me, the space ship is normal, but the Earth would look squished, rotated, and blue with everyone moving slowly. To you, however, Earth would look normal, but the space ship would be squished, rotated, blue and with everyone moving very slowly. (This gets resolved if the space ship turns around - breaking the symmetry - to come home, and results in the famous Twins \"Paradox.\")\\n\\nIn describing the laws of motion in the context of special relativity Einstein derived that E = mc^2 -- in other words that mass has a \"rest energy.\"\\n\\nIf an electron and an anti-matter electron (known as the positron) bump into each other then their is total energy conversion. The mass of two electrons is converted into energy.\\n\\nIn a fission or fusion bomb the the atomic process (breaking apart a heavy atom, or fusing some light atoms) results in a  much smaller conversion of mass to energy.

Then he hit his 72nd and pushed the single-season home run record even further out of this world. On a night when the Giants' playoff hopes were dealt a knockout blow, Bonds struck back-to-back blows for the history books as he surpassed Mark McGwire's record 70 homer plateau set in 1998 and became the single-season home run king. A game after tying Big Mac for the record in a 10-2 victory at Houston's Enron Field, Bonds ended the suspense on his first at-bat and first swing before a sellout crowd of 41,730 at Pacific Bell Park.\n"

If you have YAHOO email, there is a SPAM folder there too.  Nothing to do with a speed upgrade or a router/hub would effect your emails.

Do you mean when the planet itself is utterly disintegrated? Are you referring to a Biblical apocalypse?\\n\\nTo any of these conditions, no one can say. However, to the first one listed, our continued destruction of the environment continues to lead to more polluted air, ground, and water. And, while the melting of the ice caps will raise water a great deal and wipe out coastal cities and land, it certainly can't cover the entire planet. Stubborn as humans are, we'll probably find some way to survive through technology if we mess things up that badly, which would be extremely sad to have destroyed such beauty. We also might start a nuclear war that kills everything but cockroaches, but the planet itself would still be here. \\n\\nCondition two, where the planet is disintegrated, could be brought about by several ways, as well. A large comet, asteroid, or meteor might smash into earth, breaking it apart and causing it to no longer technically be a planet. When the sun finally goes nova (estimated to be 5 billion years away), if it reaches this far out, which his possible, it would swallow the earth, likely blowing it to bits. Then there's always the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" route, where we'll be destroyed for an intergalactic highway.\\n\\nAs for the Bible, only the Father knows. Not even Christ knows when it'll happen. People have been incorrectly interpreting the signs for hundreds of years, so all the tabloid doomsday people are probably just as wrong now.\\n\\nIn short, no one can see the future, and you're right. We don't take good care of our planet. We really should appreciate it more while we still have a planet to enjoy! Who knows, tomorrow someone might throw a nuke, so go out and enjoy earth! And just in case someone doesn't start World War III, go and take care of it, too, so that generations far into the future can look back on this time and say, \"Wow, look at all they did for their children and their children's children,\" instead of, \"How on earth could they be so selfish and uncaring?\"\n"

        "sentence": "Question: What is the meaning of 'Insurgency' and Insurgent'?\nAnswer: An insurgency is an armed uprising, revolt, or insurrection against an established civil or political authority, such as a constituted government or a military occupation by an invading force. Persons engaging in insurgency are called insurgents, and typically engage in regular or guerrilla combat against the armed forces of the established regime, or conduct sabotage and harassment in the land. The term \"insurgent\" is a pejorative from the point of view of the dominant or controlling authority—one which presumes the political legitimacy of the dominant authority. From the point of view of the uprising, the term \"rebellion\" is preferred, and hence \"rebel\" is the common term.\\n\\nIn current usage, the term \"insurgent\" is commonly used in reference to the Iraqi insurgency—armed rebels fighting against the newly-established civilian authority government in Iraq, and U.S.-led military occupation. In this context, the usage of the term \"insurgent\" has been criticized as biased, and tacitly accepting of any claimed legitimacy by the U.S. occupation and later coalition governments.\\n\\ninsurgent\\n\\nFunction: noun\\nEtymology: Latin insurgent-, insurgens, present participle of insurgere to rise up, from in- + surgere to rise -- more at SURGE\\n1 : a person who revolts against civil authority or an established government; especially : a rebel not recognized as a belligerent\\n2 : one who acts contrary to the policies and decisions of one's own political party\n"
