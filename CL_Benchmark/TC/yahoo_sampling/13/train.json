It's probably an insect bite, fleas, crabs, saber toothed crotch crickets or something like that. Wash it with a mild bleach and water solution, then put an ice pack on it for 10-15 minutes. That should get rid of the swelling and redness. Then you need to treat it with an insecticide. I suggest RAID ant and roach spray.

I use NAC which is a strong anti-oxidant and anti-viral. I haven't been sick in a year!! The way it works is it is a precursor to glutathione. Glutathione is the natural hormone that your body creates to keep your immune system up. By taking the precursor you encourage your body to take care of itself rather than becoming dependent on a pill.\\nIt is used for hep C patients too who have no immune support of their own. Great stuff! It is available at any Wild Oats or health food store.\\nI also recommend probiotics. In a healthy body there is a consistent level of healthy flora that the body maintains. If that flora is lost or flushed out it makes room for destructive viruses and bacteria. By taking probiotics you encourage the growth of healthy flora and push out the bad bacteria. There is no longer room for it to grow and flourish in order to make you sick. Primal defense probiotics are used to help victims of crohns disease live a more comfortable life.\\nI am rarely sick enough to have to take anything else when I am keeping a regular schedule with my probiotics and NAC. You will find that you poop more as your body flushes itself and kicks up your metabolism. \\n\\nHappy Healing!!\n"

Dogs with curved tails are known to be chasing flies and fleas that got on their tails. Owners of the dogs found this a nuisance that all of a sudden a dog would keep chasing its tail for several hours in a week. Due to this dogs forgot their \"job\" which was to guard sheep, or pull carts, etc.\\nSecondly, certain dogs go very wild if we pull their tails, even if its done playfully. They simply get mad at you, bite you or even kill you, if you are small.  Since little children always found it playful to pull the tails of the dogs and this meant a potential danger to their lives, the owners cut their tails short. \\nEver thought of the word CUR-TAIL? :-)\n"

        "sentence": "Title: Why do humans have the majority of hair constantly grow on head/face?\nQuestion: Think about it! What other mammal has this characteristic?\nAnswer: In contrast to most mammals, humans do not have an all-embracing intense hair on their body. Several theories have been advanced to explain the bareness of human body hair. One suggests that nature selected humans for shorter and thinner body hair as part of a set of adaptations including bipedal locomotion and an upright posture. There are several problems with this savanna theory, not least of which is that cursorial hunting is used by (other) animals that do not show any thinning of hair, and that hair similar to chimpanzees and gorillas also shades the skin from radiant heat and protects it from hot winds, and thus another mechanism for heat loss is not required. Another problem is that bipedal locomotion apparently now predates hominids moving from a forest environment to a savanna environment. A more recent theory for human hair loss has to do with a possible period of bipedal wading in a salt marsh in the Danakil region of Ethiopia, possibly occurring in the hominid lineage between 5 and 7 million years ago. As a wading animal, it was more efficient to develop short body hair and a layer of subcutaneous fat for streamlining and insulation in the aquatic environment; the eccrine sweat glands developed later after the hominids left the water; see Aquatic ape hypothesis. One problem with this theory is that both chimpanzees and gorillas have the same density and distribution of the eccrine glands, but that they have not been developed for sweat production.\\n\\nA third theory for the thin body hair on humans proposes that Fisherian runaway sexual selection played a role here (as well as in the selection of long head hair). Possibly this occurred in conjunction with neoteny, with the more juvenile appearing females being selected by males as more desirable; see types of hair and vellus hair. The human female body hair typically has more vellus hair (making the skin appear bare), while the male body typically has more terminal hair (especially on the chest, abdomen and back). Thus sexual selection can explain the sexual dimorphism in human body hair, with the results of selection being more evident (more extreme) in the female than in the male, a point which the other two theories cannot address without proposing substantially different behavior between males and females. Also, we see that artificially bare (shaved, etc.) legs, arms, etc. on women are seen as \"sexy\" even today, while body shaving is not nearly as common for men.\n"

I send my daughter to a private Christian school. Some people think it's too expensive to send their kids to Christian school, but I tell you it doesn't cost any more than daycare. Most of you probably send your kids to daycare, don't you? Also, you can't put a price on a good Christian education.  They have smaller teacher:student ratios, they focus on academics, they learn good morals, they are allowed to worship as they please (in accordance with the 1st Amendment), they score higher than the national average on tests, and they help to create productive members of society. They are not crime-and-drug ridden like so many public schools. \\nA public school would be the last place I'd send my child if I could help it.\\nIf, however, I did have to send here there, I would be on those teachers, principal and school board like white on rice.

In fact, most of the tenets of that Manifesto were accomplished in this country in the first half of the 20th century.

Talking about how young girls do the drug to lose weight.\nAnswer: As with most other habit-forming drugs, frequent use of cocaine causes the user to focus mainly on the high received from that drug, and other needs take a lower priority (sometimes much lower).  In this case, a cocaine user might be more concerned with the high from the cocaine that he or she uses it to \"replace\" most of his or her food intake.  Even basic personal hygiene, such as bathing and brushing one's teeth, might be lower on their list of priorities because in their minds: \"They gotta have that high!\"\\n\\nAs with other things in life, misinformation can really prove detrimental.

Or, is the NTRP ineffective and require overhaul?\\n\\njeffspin@comcast.net\nAnswer: Good question. Unfortunately, there are very mixed motives involved in the current classification system. Those who play in leagues or tournaments usually want the lowest rating they can get so they can win. Those who use the rating to let others know how good they are, usually want to be rated higher.\\nIf you are \"accurately\" rated, you will likely be mismatched against those who fudge. This encourages a downward push such that those who previously might have been 5.0s, for example, are now 4.5s.\\nRatings now appear to be based first on your self-assessment, which is frequently falsified, and secondly on your results. I know that players will lose a few matches on purpose just to avoid being moved up a level. This clearly is not in the best interests of the game or in fair competition.\\nSo, I do not believe the system is effective in accurately classifying players.\n"

I checked online and didn't give me such \\nexplanation.  Thank you very much.\nAnswer: We believe in the apostolic authority of the pope and the pope's infalibility in matters of faith and morals. People mess this up and say we worship the pope or believe he can't sin.\\n\\nWe believe that the Blessed Virgin Mary is to be honored above all other humans (except Jesus), and that she is the Mother of God incarnate. We ask her to intercede for us, just like you'd ask your best friend to pray for you. People misinterpret this and say we worship her. We worship God alone in the Blessed Trinity.\\n\\nWe believe that Jesus Christ instituted seven sacraments, or visible signs through which He gives us grace. All seven are biblical. (See http://biblechristiansociety.com and http://catholic.com for more information.)\\n\\nProbably one of the most central doctrines of our faith (Protestants reconize this as well) is the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Catholics take the Last Supper and John 6 literally. We believe the bread and wine becomes Jesus' Body and Blood under the appearances of Bread and wine.\\n\\nWe believe in salvation by God's grace alone. Not by faith alone, and not by works alone. We need faith and works, or faith working through love, as St. Paul puts it.\\n\\nWe also do not believe in sola scriptura, or scripture alone. We believe that Jesus left a Church to guide us (Mt. 16: 18-19) and that we need Sacred Traditon as well.\\n\\nThese are only parts of our beautiful faith. To learn more, see the websites mentioned above, as well as \\n\\nhttp://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/\\n\\nwhich is an online Catechism and holds everything Catholics believe.\\n\\nTo sum it up though,\\n\\nhttp://www.creeds.net/ancient/nicene.htm\\n\\nThis is the Nicene Creed which we say at each Mass as a congregation.\\n\\nGod Bless, hope this helps...\\n\\nA devoted Catholic Christian.\n"

He came into our house while a 14 year old child was alone, saw her and ran out.   It's a neighbor who lives across the street.  He actually confessed to the sheriffs officers eventually, and stated he had been entering our home and using our computer.  He was charged with trespassing.  \\n\\nThis is a person who we have never invited into our home, we did not even know his name until this incident.\\n\\n\\nWhen we went to sign papers on him, the clerk stated that he would probably end up not being charged, as a person has to be warned three times not to come on our property before it is considered trespassing.  Is this correct? It doesn't sound right that we can go up into anyone's home while they are not there and not have broken any laws.\nAnswer: Generally burglary statutes would apply here, but since he doesn't seem to have broken and entered in order to commit a crime, that is actually not illegal. Trespass laws do require notice, but certainly not three times, just the once is enough.\n"

They do it because somebody talks them into believing that after they commit their atrocity they will go to heaven and get 72 virgins to rape at their pleasure.  The 9/11 hijackers were all Saudis and Egyptians -- nobody took their land.  And the Palestinians who strap bombs to their children initially did it because Saadam Hussein offered $25,000 to any family whose child became a suicide bomber.  After Saadam was deposed, Hamas took over the job of rewarding the families of suicide bombers.  It is a horrible, nihilistic practice that strikes at the very heart of civilization.  It is human sacrifice.  The Muslim world should rise up and smash this death cult, and the fact that they don't makes for a strong argument that Islam needs serious reform.\n"

        "sentence": "Question: whay is the abld eagle a symbol?\nAnswer: The Bald Eagle is the national bird of the United States of America. Its national significance dates back to June 20, 1782, when the Continental Congress officially adopted the current design for the Great Seal of the United States including a bald eagle grasping arrows and an olive branch with its talons. Some states had earlier adopted the bird as a symbol; for example New York State did so in 1778.\\n\\nIn 1784, after the end of the Revolutionary War, Benjamin Franklin wrote a famous letter to his daughter from Paris criticizing the choice and suggesting the Wild Turkey as an alternative:\\n\\nFor my own part I wish the Bald Eagle had not been chosen the Representative of our Country. He is a Bird of bad moral character. He does not get his Living honestly. You may have seen him perched on some dead Tree near the River, where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the Labour of the Fishing Hawk; and when that diligent Bird has at length taken a Fish, and is bearing it to his Nest for the Support of his Mate and young Ones, the Bald Eagle pursues him and takes it from him. \\nWith all this Injustice, he is never in good Case but like those among Men who live by Sharping & Robbing he is generally poor and often very lousy. Besides he is a rank Coward: The little King Bird not bigger than a Sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the District. He is therefore by no means a proper Emblem for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America who have driven all the King birds from our Country . . . \\nI am on this account not displeased that the Figure is not known as a Bald Eagle, but looks more like a Turkey. For the Truth the Turkey is in Comparison a much more respectable Bird, and withal a true original Native of America . . . He is besides, though a little vain & silly, a Bird of Courage, and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British Guards who should presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on. \\nDespite Franklin's objections the Bald Eagle remained the emblem of the United States. Today it appears on many official seals in addition to the back of 25 cent coin.\n"
